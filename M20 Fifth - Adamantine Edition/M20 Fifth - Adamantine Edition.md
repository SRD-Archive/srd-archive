# M20 Fifth: Adamantine Edition

## What is This?

This is a trimmed-down, subminiature version of the Fifth Edition of
the World’s Most Popular Role-playing game (see license for more info)
that has been designed to be quick and easy to play.

The goal was to create a simpler game, but one where all of the
resources of the Fifth Edition (monsters, spells, adven- tures and
equipment) could be used without conversion.

## Getting Started

Get a group of 2-6 people together with some dice, paper, and pencils.
One player is the Game Master (GM), who runs all of the non-player
characters (NPCs), describes the environment, and determines the
outcome of rolls. The rest of the players make one character.

Agree upon a game concept, and then each player creates a character
concept that fits. The game is largely played through a dialogue, the
players describe their character’s attempted actions and the GM calls
for what rolls or rules are necessary.

A group of characters is usually called a party or a group. Your party
will interact with each other, the NPCs, and the universe, all under
the guidance of the GM, the dice, and the rules.

All you need to play are these rules, a set of polyhedral dice, and
something to take notes on. Every player should at least have a passing
understanding of the rules, and the GM should know enough to make
characters and run the basics.

## Polyhedral Dice

This game uses dice with 4, 8, 10, 12 and 20 sides in addition to the
usual six-sided dice. The usual notation for dice is XdY, which means
roll X dice with Y sides. (2d6 is two six-sided dice, 1d12 is one
twelve-sided dice.) If you do not have a set of polyhedral dice, the
following approximations with d6’s will get you close enough in a
pinch:

* d4: d6-1, or d6 (reroll 5/6)
* d8: d6+1
* d10: d6+2
* d12: 2d6
* d20: 3d6 (16-18 crits)

## Explanatory Notes

M20 Fifth will be easiest to understand if you are already familiar
with RPGs. For the unfamiliar reader, the following brief explanations
are offered:

Stats (aka Ability Scores) and Skills: Numerical representations of a
character’s raw physical/mental abilities and training in specific
areas, respectively. Corresponds to a bonus, which is added to rolls.

Race: The fantasy species a character belongs to.

Class: A collection of talents and abilities that describe a
character’s profession or role as an adventurer.

Level: Has two different meanings, that shouldn’t be confused.
Character level is a reflection of a character’s general growth as a
result of earning experience points (XP) from overcoming obstacles.
Spell level is the measure of a spell’s relative power.

# Characters

## Stats

There are 3 stats : Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX) and Mind (MIND).

Roll 4d6, drop lowest die. Total remaining 3 dice and allocate to one
of the stats. Repeat for remaining stats. Alternatively you may use the
array of 15, 12, 8. Stat bonus = (STAT-10)/2, round down.

## Races

* Humans: +1 to all Stats
* Magical Races (e.g. Elves, Gnomes): +2 MIND
* Tough Races (e.g. Dwarves, Half-Orcs, Dragonborn): +2 STR
* Quick Races (e.g. Halflings): +2 DEX

## Classes

The classes are Fighter, Rogue, Mage and Cleric.
Characters start at level 1 with a proficiency bonus of +2.

**Fighter**

* Skill and Save Proficiencies: Physical, STR Saves
* Armor Proficiencies: All armor, Shield
* Improved Stamina: +3 to HP per level. When taking short rests, add 3
hp per rest dice spent.
* Multiple Attacks: You gain an additional attack at 5th level, and
again at 11th and 20th level.
* Extended Crit Range: At level 3 you crit on a 19-20. At level 15 you
crit on an 18-20.
* Extra Ability Score Increase: At level 14, you get an extra ability
score increase.
* Starting Equipment: chain mail (+6 AC heavy armor), shield, one
weapon (and ammunition if applicable), 10 gp, a fast pack (see
Equipment)

**Rogue**

* Skill and Save Proficiencies: Subterfuge, DEX saves
* Armor Proficiencies: Light armor
* Sneak Attack: Whenever you have advantage, or your target is
distracted by melee combat with another foe you may add (half your
level, rounded up)d6 to your damage.
* Cunning Action: As a bonus action, you may make a Subterfuge check or
Dash.
* Starting Equipment: leather armor (+1 AC light armor), one weapon
(and ammunition if applicable), thieves tools, 15 gp, a fast pack (see
Equipment

**Mage**

* Skill and Save Proficiencies: Knowledge, MIND Saves
* Armor Proficiencies: No armor
* Signature Spell: Choose one spell (or one action-realm combination if
using Words of Power.) Casting this spell costs 1 MP less.
* Arcane Spellcasting: See Magic for more information. Starting
Equipment: spellbook, wand, 10 gp, a fast pack (see Equipment)

**Cleric**

* Skill and Save Proficiencies: Communication, MIND Saves
* Armor Proficiencies: Medium Armor, Shield
* Divine Spellcasting: See Magic for more information.
* Channel Divinity: You have the ability to channel positive energy
once per short/long rest to Turn Undead or Preserve Life. At level 6
this becomes twice per rest, and at level 18 this becomes three times
per rest. To Turn Undead the cleric brandishes their holy symbol
forcing all undead within 30 feet to make a MIND save (DC 8 + cleric’s
MIND bonus + cleric’s proficiency) or flee. If the undead roll a 1 on
their save, they are immediately destroyed. Preserve Life restores (5 *
level) hp divided to taste among allies within 30 feet.
* Starting Equipment: scale mail (+4 AC medium armor), shield, holy
symbol, mace (one-handed weapon), 15 gp, a fast pack (see Equipment)

## Backgrounds

Every character should also choose a background, which grants them
proficiency in one skill, and grounds them in the world. Every
background provides a great starting point for role-playing. Perhaps a
criminal has underworld contacts, perhaps a soldier can still get
respect among patriotic peasants, perhaps a sage can easily find
obscure information in books when they need to.

* Communication Backgrounds: Acolyte, Noble, Folk Hero, etc.
* Subterfuge Backgrounds: Criminal, Urchin, Charlatan, etc.
* Knowledge Backgrounds: Sage, Hermit, etc.
* Physical Backgrounds: Soldier, Sailor, etc.

Optional Rule (Specialization): If a character has a background which
grants a proficiency which they already get from their class, they may
add twice their proficiency bonus to d20 rolls.

## Skills and Saving Throws

There are just 4 skills : Physical, Subterfuge, Knowledge and
Communication. Roll equal to or higher than the given Difficulty Class
(DC) or opposed roll to succeed.

Skill/Saving Throw roll = d20 + stat bonus + (proficiency bonus)

For example, Climbing would use STR + Physical bonus. Dodging a falling
rock is DEX + Physical bonus. Finding a trap is MIND + Subterfuge
bonus. Disabling a trap is DEX + Subterfuge bonus.

*Common DC’s*

* Very easy: 5
* Easy: 10
* Moderate: 15
* Hard: 20
* Very hard: 25
* Nearly impossible: 30

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Whenever a character has increased or decreased odds of succeeding on a
d20 roll, the GM may elect to give that character Advantage or
Disadvantage. This involves rolling twice and taking the better or
worse of the two rolls respectively.

# Magic

All casters have Magic Points (MP) equal to their max HP. They may cast
spells of a level equal to ½ their class level, rounded up. Use the
spells from Appendix B, or the spell system described in Appendix C.
Alternatively, let casters know 6 spells of any spell level they have
access to from the Fifth Edition Basic Rules.

Concentration: Certain spells require concentration. While
concentrating on a spell, a caster may not cast other concentration
spells. If a caster is hit while concentrating on a spell, they must
make a DC 10 or half the damage taken (whichever is higher) MIND save
or the spell fizzles.

Casting a spell of any kind requires magic points. The cost is: 1 +
double the level of the spell being cast.

*Spell Level. MP Cost*

1. 3
2. 5
3. 7
4. 9
5. 11
6. 13
7. 15
8. 17
9. 19

The DC for saving throws to resist a caster’s spell is: 8 + MIND bonus
+ proficiency bonus.

## Optional Rules

* Blood Magic: Instead of having MP equal to their HP, a caster has MP
equal to half their HP. In addition, a caster may choose convert their
HP to MP at a rate of 2 HP per 1 MP.

* Ritual Casting: A caster may cast any spell without expending MP if
they take an additional 10 minutes casting the spell.

## Cantrips

A caster starts with knowledge of (MIND bonus) cantrips,
which may be any combination of damaging and utility
cantrips. A cantrip is a spell that can be cast again and again
without any MP cost.

**Damaging Cantrips**

You may make a damaging cantrip using the table below - a damaging
cantrip may add up to at most 9 points and must have a range, damage
and method. At levels 5, 11 and 17 they do an additional dice of
damage. (If a cantrip has separate beams, instead of additional dice of
damage at these levels, you get an additional beam which can target
separate creatures.)

*Points. Range, Damage, Method, Additional Effects*

1. Touch, 1d4, Magic Attack, Seperate beams
2. 10', 1d6, DEX save, Pull 10' closer to you
3. 30', 1d8, MIND save
4. 60', 1d10
5. 120', 1d12

Optional Rule (Damage Type): In addition to the effects mentioned on
the table, choose any one damage type your cantrip qualifies for based
on its range:

* Touch: Lightning (Advantage if target wearing metal armor)
* 10 ft or less: Poison
* 30 ft or less: Piercing
* 60 ft or less: Radiant, Psychic, Acid
* 120 ft or less: Necrotic, Force, Fire

**Utility Cantrips**

Instead of damaging cantrips, you may choose one of the following
utility cantrips:

* Prestidigitation: Perform minor tricks for 1 hour.
* Ghost Sound: Figment sounds for 1 minute.
* Mage Hand: 5-pound telekinesis. Lasts until concentration ends.
* Light: Object shines like a torch for 1 hour.
* Guidance: Subject gets +1d4 on one skill check. Lasts for one minute
or until discharged.
* Resistance: Subject gets +1d4 on one saving throw. Lasts for one
minute or until discharged.

# Combat

Hit Points = (1d8 + STR bonus)/Level. If HP reaches 0, unconscious and
near death. Every round, make unmodified d20 rolls to avoid death. DC
10, must get three successes before three failures.

Roll d20 + DEX bonus for initiative order. Everyone can move (30 ft.)
and perform an action each turn. Actions include: additional movement
(dashing), casting a spell and attacking. In addition, a single bonus
action may be taken if granted by a class feature, spell or other
ability.

* Melee attack bonus = STR bonus + proficiency bonus
* Missile attack bonus = DEX bonus + proficiency bonus
* Magic attack bonus = MIND bonus + proficiency bonus

Add attack bonus to d20 roll. If equal to or higher than your
opponent's Armour Class (AC), it's a hit. Natural 20 is automatically a
critical hit doing double damage.

Add STR bonus to melee damage, and DEX bonus to missile damage.

Armour Class (AC) = 10 + Armour bonus + (DEX bonus).

## Optional Rules

* Finesse: Fighters and Rogues can use DEX bonus + proficiency bonus as
Melee attack bonus and damage instead if wielding a light weapon.

* Dual Wielding: Fighters and Rogues can wield 2 light weapons and may
use an action to attack with their main weapon, and a bonus action to
attack with their offhand weapon. Don’t add your ability modifier to
the damage on the second weapon.

* Great Weapon Fighting: When a Fighter or Rogue is wielding a
two-handed weapon, they may re-roll 1 and 2 results on their damage
dice, but you must use the new roll.

## Natural Healing

Characters have rest dice equal to their level. A short rest is one
hour long, and a character may spend rest dice to regain 1d8 + STR
bonus hit points per dice. Casters regain (double level) magic points
on a short rest.

A long rest is 8 hours long. A character regains all hit points and
magic points, and half of their total rest dice. Casters regain all
magic points on a long rest.

## Improvised Hazards and Traps

Use the below information to improvise damage for things
like being pushed into a campfire or falling into lava.

Examples:

* 3d6: being pushed into a campfire, falling 30 feet
* 6d6: suffering a cave-in, falling 60 feet
* 28d6: falling into lava

*Character Level: Minor, Major, Deadly*

* 1-4: 2d6, 3d6, 6d6
* 5-10: 3d6, 6d6, 16d6
* 11-16: 6d6, 16d6, 28d6
* 17-20: 16d6, 28d6, 38d6

# Advancement

After every encounter, add up the Challenge Rating (CR) of every
monster, trap, etc. that was overcome. When the total = 10 x your
current level, you’ve advanced to the next level. Reset the total to 0
after advancing.

* Hit Points: 1d8 + STR bonus per level
* Proficiency Bonus: 1-4: +2; 5-8: +3; 10-12: +4; 13-16: +5; 17- 20: +6
* Ability Score Increases (Casters): 4, 8, 12, 16, 19
* Ability Score Increases (Non-Casters): 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19

When a character receives an ability score increase, they either gain
+2 to one stat or +1 to two stats (max 20.)

# Bestiary

**Skills and Saving Throws:** Treat a monster’s bonus for all skills
and saving throws as their attack bonus. Alternatively, assign stats to
taste and use stat bonus + (proficiency bonus) as their skill bonus.

# Equipment

## Currency

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10
silver pieces (sp). Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). A
platinum piece (pp) is worth 10 gp.

*Exchange*

* Copper piece: 1 cp, 1/10 sp, 1/100 gp, 1/1000 pp
* Silver piece: 10 cp, 1 sp, 1/10 gp, 1/100 pp
* Gold piece: 100 cp, 10 sp, 1 gp, 1/10 pp
* Platinum piece 1000 cp, 100 sp, 10 gp, 1 pp

## Armor

The cost of armor equals AC bonus times 5, squared.

* Light Armor: +1, +2 and add DEX bonus
* Medium Armor: +3, + 4, +5 and add DEX bonus (max 2)
* Heavy Armor: +6, +7, +8 no DEX bonus, disadvantage on Subterfuge
checks involving stealth
* Shield (10 gp): +2

Barding for horses costs 4 times as much as human armor, and weighs
twice as much.

## Weapons

Either use weapons from the Basic Rules of Fifth Edition, or use the
table below to improvise weapons.

**Weapon Damage by Class (Weapon Cost)**

*Class: Light (2 gp), 1-handed (10 gp), 2-handed (40 gp), Ranged (50
gp, 1 gp for 20 ammo)*

* Fighter: 1d8, 1d10, 1d12, 1d8
* Rogue 1d6, 1d8, 2d6, 1d8
* Mage: 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d6
* Cleric: 1d4, 1d6, 1d10, 1d6

## Other Equipment

To figure out a reasonable price for equipment use the
following table (for example, a bedroll would cost 10 gp,
since it’s two syllables):

*Kind of Item: Cost*

* Common Items: 1 cp x number of syllables
* Adventuring/Camping Gear: 5 gp x number of syllables
* Specialist Tools, Animals: 10 gp x number of syllables
* Luxury Items 25 gp x number of syllables
* Lethal items, Dangerous Animals: 100 gp x number of syllables

## Fast Packs

Choose a pack, or roll 1d6 to select one randomly.

**Pack A (1-2):** backpack, belt pouch, bedroll, hooded lantern, 10 oil
flasks, flint & steel, shovel, 2 sets of caltrops, signal whistle,
waterskin, iron rations (4 days)

**Pack B (3-4):** backpack, belt pouch, bedroll, 10 torches, 4 oil
flasks, flint & steel, 10 pieces of chalk, 10’ pole, mirror, crowbar,
waterskin, iron rations (4 days)

**Pack C (5-6):** backpack, belt pouch, bedroll, tent, 10 torches, 5
oil flasks, flint & steel, 50’ rope, grappling hook, 10’ pole,
waterskin, iron rations (4 days)

# GM Advice

When in doubt... Remember Whenever the players want to try something
that goes around, through, or above and beyond the rules as written,
you can always use the “GM’s Friend”... the 50% chance. Have them roll
whatever check seems most appropriate. A roll of 1-10 is a failure, a
roll of 11-20 is a success. If you feel that the situation warrants
that you favor them, assign advantage to their roll. If the situation
determines that they be hindered, then assign disadvantage.

# Appendix A: Additional Combat Options

The combat system of M20 Fifth is designed to be as simple and
streamlined as possible, but if more complexity is desired the
following options are offered:

* Surprise: If a creature fails to perceive (MIND + Sub) another
creature hiding (DEX + Sub) before a battle, they start combat
surprised. A surprised creature is unable to move, take actions or
reactions until the first round of combat is finished.

* Reactions: A character can make one reaction per round when it is not
their turn. Typical reactions include: **(a) Opportunity Attacks:**
When an opponent tries to leave your reach without taking the Disengage
action (see below), you may make a single attack against them. **(b)
Cast Certain Spells:** Spells like Feather Fall from Appendix B or
Counterspell from the Fifth Edition Basic Rules can be cast as a
reaction instead of an action.

* Disengage: A character may take a disengage action in order to safely
retreat without provoking an opportunity attack from opponents.

* Dodge: A character may take a dodge action, granting disadvantage on
all attacks until their next turn.

* Ready an Action: Instead of acting on your turn, you may ready an
action. Readying an action delays your action until you use a reaction
to trigger it later in the round.

* Knocking a Creature Out: When an attacker reduces a foe to 0 hit
points with a melee attack, the attacker may choose to knock the
creature out instead of dealing a lethal blow.

* Maneuvers: Maneuvers are special actions that a character can take
instead of just attacking. The most common maneuvers are: **(a)
Grappling:** Against a target no more than twice your height, you may
replace one attack with a grapple. Make a STR + Phys roll opposed by an
opponent’s STR + Phys or DEX + Phys roll (their choice). If you
succeed, the opponent is grappled, reducing their speed to 0, and your
speed to half. Escaping the grapple requires an action and another set
of opposed rolls. **(b) Shove:** You may shove a creature in order to
knock them prone (adv. for melee, disadv. for ranged, half of movement
to stand up), or push them away from you. Make a STR + Phys roll
opposed by an opponent’s STR + Phys or DEX + Phys roll (their choice).

* Cover: Cover adds to the AC and DEX saves of a creature, as follows:
Half Cover (+2), 3/4 Cover (+5), Full Cover (untargetable by attacks
and most spells)

# Appendix B: Spell Lists

Saving Throws and Scaling: Unless a spell specifically mentions using a
spell attack or not granting a saving throw, the target of a spell may
resist by making an appropriate STR/DEX/MIND save. If a spell does
damage, then successfully saving causes that spell to do half the
damage it would have.

Many spells end with something like “+Xd6 per spell level above Yth.”
What this means is that the spell is Yth level spell, but if it is cast
in a (Y+1)th level spell slot or higher it has some sort of scaling
effect.

# Appendix C: Words of Power Spell System

All magic requires saying two words of power: an action and a realm.
Every 1st level caster starts out knowing three words of power, but
must know at least one action and one realm. They learn new Words of
Power every three levels (3, 6, 9, etc.)

## Optional Rules

* White and Black Magic: Clerics draw their power from white magic, and
may not use their magic to directly harm an individual. Mages draw
their power from black magic and may not directly heal an individual.

* Elemental Specialization: At the start of a day, a caster who knows
the Energy realm must choose one particular type of damage (acid, fire,
etc.) For that day, they may only use the Energy realm with relation to
that type of damage. Alternatively, make a caster choose a damage type
upon learning Energy - their magic is only capable of interacting with
that type of energy.

## The Four Actions

* Enhance (augeo): Strengthen, Heal, Enlarge, Repair, Sharpen, etc.
* Diminish (infirmo): Weaken, Damage, Injure, Reduce, Break, Dull,
Deteriorate, etc.
* Communicate With (defero): Sense, Read, Seek, Inform, Determine,
Understand, etc.
* Control (tempero): Shape, Hold, Command, Form, Direct, Dictate, etc.
(Control can only be learned after all other actions have been
learned.)

## The Five Realms

* Body (corpus): Bodies of living things, plants.
* Mind (mentus): The thinking, feeling and conscious part of an entity.
* Spirit (animus): Essence or soul. (Spirit can only be learned after
you have at least three Realms and three Actions.)
* Energy (navitas): Fire, liquid water, air, magic, electricity, and
(optionally) time.
* Matter (materia): Solid, mindless material like stone, ice, metal,
wood, leather, paper, etc.

If the caster is just trying to damage another creature, the caster
makes a magic attack vs. AC. Otherwise, the creature must make a saving
throw vs. the caster’s spell DC. (The appropriate saving throw is
decided by the GM. For example, dodging a fireball might be DEX, while
resisting the effects of mind control might be MIND.)

**Damage and healing** starts at 3d6 at spell level 1, and increases by
3d6 every spell level.

For **other effects** besides simple damage and healing, roll damage
starting at 2d6 at spell level 1, and increasing by 2d6 every spell
level.

* If the target fails their saving throw, and their current HP is less
than the damage rolled, they are instantly affected by the spell but
take no damage.
* If the target fails their saving throw, and their current HP is
greater than the damage rolled then they take the damage rolled but are
not affected by the spell.
* If the target succeeds on their saving throw, they take half the
damage rolled.

Positive effects used on willing targets bypass the need for saving
throws, and immediately take effect. A creature can only be transformed
into something of equal or lesser CR/level to themselves.

**Duration:** Spells that affect inanimate objects are generally
permanent; an enlarged pebble will stay large, a broken belt will stay
mended. Magically created fires, etc, will die down naturally. Living
creatures will remain affected by a spell for 1 round per spell level
of the spell that affected them. A caster may concentrate on a spell in
order to keep the spell active longer. While concentrating, a caster
may not cast any spells besides simple damage and healing spells or
cantrips.

# Appendix D: Magic Items

To quickly make magic items, decide between a spell item which
reproduces a spell from Appendices B or C, or a bonus item which
provides a +1 to +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls (weapons), or AC
(armor and shields.) All bonus items, and some spell items require
attunement slots, which each character has 3 of.

There are three kinds of spell items:

* Consumables: Single use items such as potions or scrolls.
* Renewable use (Attunement): Contains charges that renew daily.
Usually 3 charges a day, or 4 hours of effect per day.
* Constant use (Attunement): Provides a continuous effect. Use the
following guidelines when distributing items or estimating their price
should the party try to sell them:

*Rarity: Minimum Level (Value) Spell Levels (Armor, Weapon)*

* Common: 1st (100 gp) Cantrip, 1st (n/a, n/a)
* Uncommon: 1st (500 gp) 2nd-3rd (n/a, +1)
* Rare: 5th (5000 gp) 4th-5th (+1, +2)
* Very Rare: 11th (50,000 gp) 6th-8th (+2, +3)
* Legendary: 17th (500,000 gp) 9th (+3, n/a)

Note: Divide the value by 2 for renewable use, and 10 for consumables.

# Appendix E: Quick and Dirty Monsters

To make monsters on the fly, use the below rules:

1) Choose monster’s Challenge Rating.

* HP= (5 x CR)d8 or 20 x CR
* AC= 12 + prof. bonus (max 19)
* Save DC= 12 + prof. bonus
* DPR (Damage Per Round)= 8 + (6 x CR)
* Atk. Bonus= 3 + prof. bonus
* Prof. Bonus= Treat CR as level, and use proficiency bonus indicated
in Advancement.

2) Adjust offensive (save DC, DPR, atk. bonus) and defensive stats (AC,
HP) as desired. Treat the monster as having a higher CR for offensive
or defensive stats. For every one CR you move up, you should move down
one CR in the opposite kind of stat.

3) Choose a monster template. (“X DPR dmg”, means “do X times DPR
damage”.)

* Aberration: multiattack (two tentacles), tentacle (0.5 DPR dmg, STR
save or paralyzed. If target is paralyzed and damage reduces target to
0 HP, target's brain is eaten.)

* Beast: multiattack (claw and bite), claw (0.5 DPR dmg), bite (0.5 DPR
dmg) Draconic: breath weapon (DPR dmg, DEX save to avoid), bite (0.5
DPR dmg)

* Elemental: smash (0.6 DPR dmg), death throes (when creature dies,
make STR save or take 0.6 DPR dmg)

* Fey: multiattack (two attacks), shillelagh/shortbow (0.5 DPR dmg),
fey charm (MIND save or become friend for 24 hours), invisibility
(lasts until it attacks or uses fey charm)

* Fiendish: aura (at start of turn, 0.3 DPR dmg to all within 5 feet),
trident (0.6 DPR dmg), fireball (0.6 DPR dmg)

* Giant: punch (DPR dmg), boulder (DPR dmg) Undead: multiattack (life
drain and slam), life drain (0.4 DPR, STR save or reduce victim's max
HP by dmg taken), slam (0.5 DPR)

* Vermin: bite/sting (DPR damage, STR save or poisoned causing
disadvantage on attacks), web/goo (DEX save or restrained)

4) Add any special abilities desired. (e.g. Flight or spellcasting.)

5) Add resistances (half damage from specific source) and immunities
(not affected by specific source.) If you add many resistances or a few
immunities, multiply hit points by the following values: CR 1-4 (0.5),
CR 5-8 (0.7), CR 11- 16 (0.8) CR 17+ (1)

* Physical damage types: Slashing, piercing, bludgeoning.

* Magic damage types: acid, fire, cold, poison, necrotic, radiant,
lightning, psychic, thunder and force

* Condition immunities: paralyzed, poisoned, charmed, etc.

# Appendix F: Boss Monsters

A boss monster can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. Using its
**legendary resistance** it can treat a failed saving throw as a
success a certain number of times a day, and using its **legendary
actions** it can act at the end of another creature’s turn a certain
number of times per round. The actions it can take in this way are as
follows:

* Costs 1 Action: Make a Single Attack, Move, Cast a Cantrip
* Costs 2 Actions: Use a Special Ability, Cast a Spell, Multiattack

To turn an ordinary monster into a boss monster, pick a tier below
(rounding CR down for initial CR 1/2 and lower):

*Tier: (Legendary Actions/round and Resistance/day) Other Bonuses*

* Elite: (1) +20 HP +1 CR
* Boss: (2) +30 HP, +2 CR
* Legendary: (3) +40 HP, +3 CR
* Epic: (4) +50 HP, +4 CR

# Appendix G: Scaling Monsters

To scale monsters from the Bestiary, or the Fifth Edition Basic rules,
simply determine what you want the new CR to be, and then use the below
adjustments:

* Prof. Bonus = Treat CR as level, and use proficiency bonus indicated
in Advancement.

* ΔCR = New CR - Old CR
* HP = +20 HP x ΔCR
* DPR = +6 dmg x ΔCR (remember to split for multiattacks)
* ΔPB = New Prof. Bonus - Old Prof. Bonus.
* AC = +ΔPB (max 19)
* Save DC = +ΔPB
* Atk. Bonus = +ΔPB

**Deadly abilities:** When scaling down creatures with fairly deadly
abilities, it is also suggested that the severity of the condition is
reduced. For example a medusa’s petrifying gaze might just become a
paralyzing gaze for a CR 1 medusa.

**Multiattack:** When scaling up, if the DPR increase ever (roughly)
equals one of a creature’s attacks consider giving the creature
multiattack instead of just making their single attack twice as strong.
When scaling down, if the DPR decrease ever (roughly) equals one of a
creature’s attacks, consider removing one of their attacks from their
multiattack (or completely removing multiattack if the creature only
has two attacks.)

## Credits

Like any creative human endeavor, I stand on the shoulders of giants.
I’d like to thank and credit a few people for the inspiration they have
provided in inspiring this project.

First, to Robin V. Stacey, Darrell King and Al Krombach for reminding
us that you don’t need hundreds of pages of rules to sit around a
table, roll dice, and have fun with your friends. Thanks also are due
to Seth Drebitko for continuing to carry the torch of micro-sized RPGs
all these years. A huge thanks is due to Wyatt Bury, for freeing us
from the tyranny of lists - a philosophy which I have employed
extensively in making this project.
