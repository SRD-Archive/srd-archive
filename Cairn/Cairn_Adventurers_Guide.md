# CAIRN Adventurer’s Guide Moduar Rules and Procedures for Cairn RPG 

by Adam Hensley. Text licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0 

This document lists some optional, modularly-designed rules and 
procedures for Cairn. They’re designed to be plug-n-play, so just grab 
what you like and discard the rest. They aren’t critical to the 
structure of the game and are completely optional.

Note: L is used in reference to player level. Example: A level 2 player 
would see Ld6 and roll 2d6.

## NPC Reactions

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not 
obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table.

* 2: Hostile
* 3-5: Wary
* 6-8: Curious
* 9-11: Friendly
* 12: Helpful

**What Do They Want?** Most NPCs will have something they want. Roll a 
d10 on the following table to find out what they want.

**D10. Want: Description**

1. Food: You can distract them with rations, point them towards 
corpses, cast a food illusion.
2. Aid: They could be hurt and need medical aid of some sort.
3. Money: They want money. Extortion, toll, tax, tribute, or greed.
4. Valuables: Rare or unique items. Excellent pairings can result in 
their friendship or gaining as allies.
5. Territory: This is their turf. They will defend it, ask you to 
leave, or to prove why you should be able to pass through.
6. Info: They want to know about a nearby NPC, faction, landmark, or 
location.
7. Help: They need something from nearby, probably somewhere dangerous. 
Kill something, clear out an area, retrieve something.
8. Trade: They have random equipment (from each category on equipment 
tables) and want to trade or sell. 1 in 6 chance they have something 
rare or valuable. Good business means possible friendship.
9. Mission: They’re in service to another nearby NPC or faction and are 
helping to achieve a goal for them.
10. Directions: They are lost and need directions somewhere, or help 
being escorted there safely.

## Dungeon Exploration

**Dungeon Turns**

A dungeon turn is approximately 10 minutes. Dungeon exploration can be 
turned into a subsystem of managing resources, making strategic 
decisions, and structuring the dungeon crawl into a sort of mini-game. 
There is an element of pushing your luck as you spend more time 
searching, checking for hidden things, and lingering in dangerous 
locations. Time spent always has a cost, and that cost is provoking an 
encounter roll. These encounters can involve running into monsters, but 
can also challenge or reward the party in other ways.

**Sequence of Play Per Turn**

1. Encounter Roll: GM makes a d6 loaded encounter roll once every
few dungeon turns, or at their discretion.
2. Actions: The party decides what action to take. (e.g. moving,
searching, listening, entering or exiting rooms).
3. Description: GM describes and resolves what happens. If encounters
were rolled, they happen here. If (1) was rolled on the encounter die,
make a reaction roll and proceed from there.
4. End of turn: GM updates time, and management of light, food,
need to rest, or any sort of usage dice rolls can be made.

**Dungeon Turn Movement**

* Players can move carefully about 200 ft. in a 10 minute turn. Players 
moving carefully spot signs of all traps. Traps should be designed to 
be disarmed or subverted with ingenuity and creative thinking using 
common sense and inventory.
* Players can quickly move 600 ft. in a 10-minute turn. Players moving 
quickly may get a chance to roll under WIL to notice a trap (GM 
discretion). Otherwise, they may trigger a trap if it is concealed 
(usually 1-2 on a d6, adjust as necessary for trap deadliness)

**Searching**

* A quick search takes 1 minute, covers roughly a 30x30’ space, and
reveals only the most obvious information.
* A detailed search takes 10 minutes (1 turn), covers roughly a 30x30’
space, and reveals most hidden information, at the GM’s discretion.
* You can replace 30x30 with small, medium, and large rooms, and
require additional turns to complete a detailed search.

**Loaded Encounter Roll**

Roll a d6 encounter dice every 2 or 3 rounds (at your discretion, adjust
as needed) or when players make noise. Only a roll of 1 will result in an
encounter, and they won’t always be hostile. Roll the reaction dice to see
their disposition, and remember that they’re already doing something.
Optionally, you can roll non-loaded encounters with only and encounter
occurring on a roll of 1, while nothing else happens otherwise.

1. Encounter (roll on encounter table or choose, roll reactions + 
wants)
2. Sign (Clue, “spoor”, track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, 
droppings, etc.)
3. Locality (context-dependent timer, water rising, ritual completing, 
The party's surroundings shift or escalate in some way.)
4. Exhaustion (rest next round or deprived)
5. Expiration (Ongoing effects end, light usage roll, resource usage, 
bellies rumble.)
6. Discovery or Treasure (The party finds something interesting and 
possibly beneficial.)

**Light**

Torches, lanterns, and other radial sources of light illuminate 40’ 
clearly and provide dim outlines and shadows for a further 40’. In the 
dark, light sources are visible miles away. Standard torches will last 
about 6 turns, or 1 hour, before they burn out.

## Wilderness Exploration

**Hex Crawling**

Each hex represents 6 miles. An adventuring day is divided into 6 turns 
of approximately 4 hours each. Two of these phases, approximately 8 
hours, must be spent sleeping in order to avoid becoming deprived. In 
each turn, the following procedure is followed:

1. Exploration Action: The party decides on one exploration action for
that turn.
2. Event Roll: The GM rolls on the event die for encounters and other
random events.
3. Resolution: The action and event rolls are resolved.

**Exploration Actions**

The party may choose one of the following standard actions each
4-hour wilderness turn.

* Travel: Exiting a hex and moving into an adjacent one.
* Roads: The party travels through two tiles (three if mounted).
* Standard Terrain: 1 tile is traversed.
* Difficult Terrain: 1/2 tile is traversed. (requires 8 hours, or 2
turns)
* Treacherous Terrain: 1/4 tile is traversed. (requires 16 hours, or 4
turns)
* Getting Lost: There is a 1-in-6 chance, when traveling off-road,
of getting lost. This is increased to 2-in-6 in tiles classified as
difficult or treacherous. An experienced woodsman or explorer
decreases the chance of getting lost by 1-in-6.
* Off-Course: When lost, assign a number to each adjacent tile
starting from the top (north) as 1, continuing clockwise. Roll 1d6
and move the players one tile off-course that direction.
* Weather: Adverse weather can optionally increase the chances of
getting lost or the difficulty of the terrain, at your discretion.
* Reorientation: If players get lost, they will need to spend the
next turn reorienting themselves.
* Explore: Looking for interesting features within a hex. There
is a 4-in-6 chance of discovering the main location in the hex
description. Difficult terrain reduces this to 3-in-6. An experienced
woodsman increases the chance by 1-in-6.
* Locate: Looking for something which was previously encountered
in a hex. The basic chance is 5-in-6 or 4-in-6 in difficult terrain. An
experienced woodsman, tracker, or navigator increases the chance
by 1-in-6.
* Interact: Staying in the current location (e.g. exploring a dungeon,
town, etc).
* Camp: Resting and/or sleeping. See later for details on resting in
the wilds.
* Forage: Hunt, fish, or forage for food. There is a basic 3-in-6 chance
of success. An experienced hunter, angler, or woodsman increases
the chance.

**Event Roll**

The GM rolls a d6 and consults the table appropriate to the party’s
location.

1. Encounter: Roll on an encounter table for that terrain type
or location. Don’t forget to roll for reaction and want.
2. Sign: Clue, spoor, or indication of nearby encounter, locality,
hidden feature, or information about a nearby hex.
3. Locality: Shifts in weather, terrain, or other local changes.
4. Expiration: Resources are drained in some way. Roll a d4. 1-2: 
Exhaustion (rest for a turn or add 1 fatigue); 3-4: Hunger (Eat a 
ration or add 1 fatigue)
5. Discovery: Discover something useful such as food, treasure, or
other resources.
6. Hidden Feature: The main feature of the hex is discovered, or,
choose or roll randomly for a unique hex feature from a random
table. Options include small dungeons, secret areas, factions, etc.

## Leveling Up

**Experience Points (XP)**

Gain a new level every 1,000 XP. Optionally increase the XP needed each
level. A good place to start is adding between 500-1,000 XP each level.

**Gaining XP**

Experience points are gained at a rate of 1 XP for every 1 gold (or your
game’s standard currency) retrieved and returned to the safety of a town
or your base of operations.

Increasing HP and Ability Scores
Each time you level up:
* Roll 1d6 and add to your HP total.
* Re-roll each Ability Score with 3d6. If a result is higher than your
current score, increase that Ability Score by 1.

## Carousing

You can spend your hard-earned credit on experiences rather than on 
things. Carousing lets you double-dip your experience by spending it at 
a 1-1 ratio. The more you spend, the more impactful or eventful your 
experience. Carousing represents having a good time, donating your 
money, investing in a “business opportunity”, or some other experience 
involving your wealth and blowing off steam. Alter these tables or add 
your own mishaps and fortunes. They generally represent getting into 
shenanigans while inebriated but can also be sober celebratory 
outcomes.

**Carousing Roll**

Declare the amount of gold you’re spending and roll 2d6 to see how your
evening went.

*2d6: How Things Went*

* 2-5: Experience is gained. However, you’ve all made fools of yourself 
in some manner. Roll on the carousing mishaps table.
* 6-9: Experience is gained.
* 10+: Experience is gained. You’ve all had a stroke of good luck! Roll 
on the carousing fortunes table!

**Mishaps and Fortunes**

Roll 1d6, adding + 1 to the results for every 100 gp you carouse with
(increase this amount at your preference, or as players level up.) More
decadent partying comes with the potential of more volatile or legendary
consequences. See the mishaps and fortunes table on the next page to see
what happens. Alternatively, just roll a 1d12 and check the results.

**D6+: Mishaps**

1. Start a brawl. You all are involved in a brawl that gets out of 
control. Start the next adventure with a black eye and -1 STR per 
level. The local tavern keeper is no longer quite as amicable.
2. Minor misunderstanding with local authorities that you’re unable to 
smooth over. You all spend the next 1d6 days in jail. Now seen as local 
troublemakers.
3. One of you insulted a local person of rank. They will hold a grudge 
unless you all publicly apologize and humiliate yourself before them.
4. Hangover from hell. The first 2d6 hours adventuring the next day are
done with disadvantage to all STR saves.
5. Gambling binge. Your party owes a collective debt equal to roughly
half the amount spent carousing to someone you’d rather not own
money to.
6. You’ve ruined the local economy! Your excess spending means that all
prices are now double until next session.
7. Major misunderstanding with local authorities. All equipment is 
confiscated until fines and bribes totaling 1d6 x 100 gold is paid.
8. While in a drunken stupor and a spot of trouble, you sought refuge
in a church. They took care of you but now as repayment have begun
hounding you to perform a charitable act.
9. Bad Investment. Invest all your spare coin in some smooth-tongued 
merchant’s scheme. Turns out it’s a sham. One of the towns merchants 
flees.
10. Due to a lost game of darts and a few inflammatory remarks at the 
tavern, you make bitter enemies with a local rival adventuring party.
11. Beaten and robbed. You are waylaid by a bunch of thugs during your
drunken carousing. Collectively lose L6d100 coins.
12. The roof! The roof! The roof is on fire! Accidentally start a 
conflagration Roll 1d6 twice. (1-2) burn down your favorite inn (3-5) 
some other den of ill repute is reduced to ash (6) a big chunk of town 
goes up in smoke. (1-2) no one knows it was you guys (3-5) one other 
person knows you did it (6) everybody knows.

## Fortunes

* Jackpot! One of you strikes it rich at the gambling tables! Gain 
level x 100 gold.
* Gain a local reputation as the life of a party! Those of ill repute 
are much more friendly and see you as one of their own.
* Whoa what a trip! The strange powder you sniffed revealed mystic 
truths about the universe. Young people in the settlement see you as 
cool and not one of the squares. (Optional: gain a random spell or 
generate a Maze Rats spell, either one-use or permanent.)
* Well fed, well rested, and ready to go! The next day of adventuring 
all saves are done with advantage. Citizens arrest! You catch some 
criminal in the act and are able to restrain them until the authorities 
arrive. You are seen as hero’s by the settlement for a short time.
* The local blacksmith, due to your influx of cash, has been able to 
order in an exquisite weapon that he’s willing to sell to you guys for 
the normal price.
* The local clergy see you guys as protectors of the settlement. They 
offer you a blessing before your next adventure. Impressed by your 
ability to drink for days and keep standing, a local hireling of high 
repute is willing to join you on your next adventure if you wish at no 
initial cost.
* Killer Investment! Invest all your spare cash in some smooth-tongued 
merchant’s scheme. Turns out it’s real! It returns 50% profits next d4 
sessions.
* Local celebrity. Your ability to carouse with the common folk as lead 
them to see you as one of their own. The peasants of the settlement are 
thankful to have you around. You receive free room and board in this 
settlement of poor quality.
* Hot Goss. Your time spent carousing has let you in on some juicy 
gossip. You learn one major secret about a person in authority.
* Heroic Carousing! It was a night of truly epic debauchery. Everyone 
roll a d6 to see how your legend grew. (1) Re-roll HP for that level, 
take new result if higher, increase by 1 if lower. (2) Gain 1 STR (3) 
Gain 1 DEX (4) Gain 1 WIL, (5) Gain a random spell book (6) Gain Ld6 x 
100 GP.

## Vices

Vices serve as both character growth and a way to pressure PC’s pockets 
and keep them continuing to adventure and acquire wealth to support 
their vice. If PCs start out with a group debt, a vice is a nice way to 
continue bleeding their wealth after they pay off their debt.

**Gaining Vices**

Players can roll for a vice during character creation, or acquire one 
through the fiction of play. Roll a d8 for a random vice. Otherwise, 
consult the triggers for suggestions on what might trigger a character 
to develop a vice. You can require them failing a WIL save after 
hitting a trigger if you wish. Alternatively they can willingly take on 
a vice they find interesting.

**Satisfying Vices**

Vices must be appeased once a week or the PC must pass a WIL save. 
Failing a WIL save adds the deprived condition until they satisfy their 
vice. Appeasing a vice should cost money in some way, whether directly 
from money or indirectly via resources.

**D10. Vice: Description. (Trigger) Satisfying the vice.**

1. Gambling: Playing cards, throwing dice, or other forms of risking 
money to games of chance. (Major win or loss at a high stakes game or 
wager.) Gamble with at least 10% of your personal wealth, wager a 
unique/useful/powerful item, put other major stakes up.
2. Alcohol: Drinking ale, wine, spirits, or other alcoholic beverages 
that intoxicate your senses. (Consuming large amounts of booze, 
drinking heavily for multiple days.) Binging heavily, buying rounds for 
the whole bar, brewing your own booze.
3. Drugs: Narcotic delights to smoke, snort, or consume in search of 
oblivion. (Indulging in addictive substances, overuse of stims/ 
chemicals/boosters.) Regularly indulging in your addiction, massive 
binges, expensive synthetics or cures.
4. Lust: Pleasures of the flesh such as daliances with strangers or 
paid sex workers. (Regular visits to brothels, unique or novel sexual 
experiences.) Indulging with new partners, frequent copulation, finding 
lusty or kinky novelties.
5. Luxury: Expensive clothing, decadent food, art, and general 
opulence. (Experiencing massive decadence, acquiring rare forms of 
wealth.) Blowing your money on ostentatious displays, buying expensive 
clothes/food/art, patronage of an artist or savant.
6. Weird: Consorting with devils, contacting unknown entities, and 
performing forgotten or forbidden rituals. (Consorting with strange 
entities, exposure to forces beyond comprehension.) Discovering 
forbidden knowledge/magic/items, growing weirder, gaining corruption, 
learning weird secrets.
7. Obligation: Devotion to a cause, organization, charity, or family. 
(Experiencing charity or aid, supporting another through difficulty, 
developing a strong sense of duty.) Supporing your obligation through 
financial assistance or help.

bloodshed yourself. (Regularly spectating or participating extreme 
violence, especially as entertainment.) Watch or bet on bloodsports,

keep, raising an army, attaining status.) Making significant progress 
toward your ambition. Spending money towards your goal.

## Advanced Combat Options

**Weapon Traits**

Below are some optional traits a magical or good quality weapon might 
have. Sweep, parry, and reach are traits any weapon of that type can 
have. Any of the other traits should be limited to 1 per rare, special, 
or magic weapon.

* Sweep: (2 handed weapons only) Make a second attack against an enemy 
within reach if you roll for maximum damage or your attack reduces the 
targets HP to zero or lower.
* Parry: (swords and daggers only) Melee damage of 1-2 is harmlessly 
parried away.
* Reach: (polearms only) When attacked with a melee weapon without 
reach, the attacker must roll half or higher on their damage roll or 
else you get to attack them first.
* Enchanted: (magic weapons) Damage ignores armor.
* Brutal: (magic bludgeoning weapons; 2h only) Critical Damage 
resulting from a Damage roll of 8 or more from this weapon is an 
instant kill, and forces a morale Save on the enemy.
* Deadly: (magic weapons; rare) Re-roll on max damage and add to total.
* Vorpal: (magic blades; rare) Damage immediately bypasses HP, going 
straight to STR and requiring a save against Critical Damage
* Blood-Thirsty: (cursed magic weapons; rare) On max damage, upgrade 
dice type. 6>8>10. 10 on a d10 will reset the weapon to its base dice 
and the weapon will need 2d6 hours to recharge. Should have some type 
of curse or drawback.
* Shield Splintering: Players can opt to absorb all damage and effects 
from an attack in exchange for their shield breaking.

**Magic Damage Types**

Below are some magic weapon damage types other than +1 damage.
Magic damage type on a weapon should lower it’s damage by 1 dice size
to account for the extra effect.

* Cold: On a hit, target makes a STR save or next attack is impaired.
* Thunder: On a hit, target makes a DEX save or can’t move next turn.
* Necrotic: On a hit, target makes a WIL save or loses next turn.
* Poison: On a hit, target makes a STR save or 1d4 damage for 1d4 rounds.

* Disintegration: On a hit, target makes a DEX save vs instant 
obliteration and the wielder takes 1 fatigue. Exceptionally powerful and 
rare.

**Special Materials**

Most weapons will be made from steel. Some special weapons, however,
could potentially come from different materials. Consider making a
weapon of a special material one dice size less to compensate for its
advantages.

* Cold-Iron: Heavy and prone to breaking. Enhanced vs. fey.
* Silver: Expensive. Enhanced vs. undead and certain monsters.
* Mithril: Elven alloy. Silvery-gold. Enhanced vs. goblins.
* Orichalcum: Dwarven alloy. Deep red-bronze. Enhanced vs. undead.
* Electrum: Magically forged alloy. Green-gold. Enhanced vs. demons.
* Meteor Ore: Rare star metal. Multi-hued. Enhanced vs. dragons.
