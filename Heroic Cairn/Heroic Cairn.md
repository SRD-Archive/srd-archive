# Heroic Cairn Player's Handbook

![Dragon Logo](./spiked-dragon-head.png)

**Cairn** is an adventure game for one facilitator (the **Warden**) and
at least one other player. Players act as hardened adventurers
exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden
treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities.

**Heroic Cairn** consolidates and updates Cairn rules for ancestries,
classes, combat and spell modifiers, and includes additional spells.

# *Cairn* was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

**Neutrality:** The Warden's role is to portray the rules, situations,
NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

**Death:** Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to
harm in its many forms. Death is always around the corner, but it is
never random or without warning.

**Fiction First:** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle's difficulty
or its outcome. Instead, success and failure are arbitrated by the
Warden in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements.

**Growth:** Characters are changed through in-world advancement,
gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and
overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice:** Players should always understand the reasons behind
the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should
be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles:** The Warden and the players each have guidelines that
help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking,
exploration, and an emergent narrative.

**Shared Objectives:** Players trust one another to engage with the
shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the
party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Wardens

**Information**

* Provide useful information about the game world as the characters
explore it.
* Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
* Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
* Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know
they can keep asking questions.

**Difficulty**

* Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
* If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no
roll will allow them to do it.
* Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation
sensible? Let it happen.
* Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all
that is necessary for risky actions.

**Preparation**

* The game world is organic, malleable and random. It intuits and
makes sharp turns.
* Use random tables and generators to develop situations, not stories
or plots.
* NPCs remember what the PCs say and do,and how they affect the world.
* NPCs don't want to die. Infuse their own self-interest and will to
live into every personality.

**Narrative Focus**

* Emergent experience of play is what matters, not math or character
abilities. Give the players weapon trainers and personal quests to
facilitate improvement and specialization.
* Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players,then put
realistic opportunities in their path.
* A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive
armor and impressive training.

**Danger**

* The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player
characters.
* Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more
dangerous, the more obvious.
* Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out
a solution.
* Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the
world.

**Treasure**

* A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered.
It tells a story.
* Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful
beyond its worth and prestige.
* Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
* Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of
intimidating foes.

**Choice**

* Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation
lulls.
* Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are
vague.
* Work together with this conversational progress to keep the game
moving.
* Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the
game world.

**Die of Fate**

* Occasionally you will want an element of randomness (e.g. the
weather, unique character knowledge,etc.).
* In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more generally favors
the players.
* A roll of 3 or under tends to mean bad luck for the PCs or their
allies.

## Principles for Players

**Agency**

* Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are
tools.
* Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do,
too.
* Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

**Teamwork**

* Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
* Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other
and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

**Exploration**

* Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any
stats, items, or skills you have.
* Take the Warden's description without suspicion, but don't shy away
from seeking more information.
* There is no single correct way forward.

**Talking**

* Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity
to safely gain information and solve problems.
* You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk
things through before getting violent.

**Caution**

* Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether
violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
* Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem
unfavorable.

**Planning**

* Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance,
subtlety, and fact-finding.
* Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

**Ambition**

* Set goals and use your meager means to take steps forward.
* Expect nothing. Earn your reputation.
* Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.

# Character Creation

## Ancestry

Choose an ancestry for your character.

**Dwellers of the Underground**

* Darkvision: Perfect vision in low-light, somewhat blinded by bright
lights.
* Earthhardy: You are tougher than sun-dwellers, often recovering from
injuries or poison thought to be lethal.

**Fair Folk**

* Magic-Sense: You can tell when arcane energies are at work.
* Third Eye: You cannot be fooled by magical illusions, save those
created by one of your own.

**Smallfolk**

* Easily Missed: Enemies tend to ignore you, going for the bigger
targets first or ignoring you altogether.
* Quicksilver: Escaping sudden capture or a killing blow is like second
nature to you. Sneaking comes naturally, too.

**Greenskin**

* Blood Brothers: If any fellow adventrues go first in battle, then you
also go first.
* Battle Fury: Once per day you may perform an Enhanced blast attack.

**Humankind**

* Eclectic: Humans are many and varied. Select an additional
backgrpound.
* Aggresive Oppertunist: Once per day, you can re-roll a damage roll.

Or make your own Ancestry, choosing any two festures from the above.
For example, a goblin character might choose to have Quicksilver and
Blood Brothers. Or, a gnome might have Easily Missed and Magic-Sense.

# Classes

Choose a class for your character.

## Warrior Classes

You are the Fighter, the Mercenary, the Barbarian, the Gladiator, The
Knight. You are the master of the arts of combat and warfare.

**Fighter:** Fighters can come from many backgrounds, but for all,
their familiarity with combat helps you sieze opertnity on the
battlefield. You score critical hits on a 16 through 20.

**Mercenary:** You have a contact you can turn to in almost every city.
They aren’t always happy to see you, though. Men blindly follow you in
battle (they always pass morale saves). If you are attacking a target
with others, you grant a +2 instead of a +1 to the damage.

**Barbarian:** Your place is in the wilderness, you despise
civilization and fear magic. You drink blood like ale, regain 1d3 HP
when you kill or CD an enemy. Your battle rage is so strong that you
can harm creatures immune to mundane damage.

**Gladiator:** Your favored weapon is an extension of youself, and 
deals the next highest damage dice. For example, if it was a dagger it 
would do d8. You are a trained merciless killer. Your reputation is not 
always serving you and your former master is probably looking for you.

**Knight:** Your rank gives you credibility with the nobles. The
peasantry will generally follow you into dangerous situations without
the slightest hesitation. However if you fail them somehow, they may
strip you of your rank. You are also a skilled horseman, your mounted
attacks are enhanced.

Character creation:

* Start with 1d4+2 HP.
* Swirl: do a Blast attack and gain 1 Fatigue.
* Death Storm: when you kill or CD an enemy you can attack again.

Starting Gear:

* Roll 1d10+10 on the Armor Table.
* Roll 1d10+10 on the Helmets and Shields Table.
* Roll for Weapons and choose a second one.
* Roll the rest as usual.

## Divine Classes

You are the Cleric, the Druid, the Paladin. You are a faithful servant
of your deity. Battle ready to channel the power of your cult.

**Cleric:** You always find help and resources in the temple of your
deity but stay in line with the dogma of your religion or be
disfavored. You can invoke the divine power, brandishing your holy
symbol, to repel undead (creatures Save WIL to resist). Clerics know 2
Cantrip spells.

**Druid:** You belong to the wild lands and feel uncomfortable in
cities. You worship the elements and the old bestial deities. You can
communicate with animals and always find resources in the wilderness.
You have two options: 1) **Spellweaver Druids**, that can shape-shift
into one type of animal and know 2 Cantrip spells. Or 2) **Wildform
Druids**, that can shape-shift into any animal, but cannot use
Cantrips. For all Druids, shap-shifting costs 1 Fatigue. Taking
**critical damage** causes a Druid to revert back to their human form.

**Paladin:** As a sacred warrior of your faith you will be obeyed by
zealots. Priests will favor you but if you step out of the line you
will fall in disgrace. You dedicate your life to the cult and sworn vow
of humility (you should not hoard treasures). Once per day you can Lay
on Hands on someone to cure disease, poison or heal 1d6 STR. Paladins
do not know any Cantrips.

Character creation:

* Salvation Grace: Once per day you heal 1D6 to any abilities but you
became Deprived until you take the time to mediate, pray or sleep.
* Miracles: Every day, you can choose 3 Cleric spells related to your
religion to cast without Spellbooks while holding your holy symbol.

Starting Gear:

* You start with a holy symbol from your deity.
* Roll 1d12+8 on the Armor Table.
* Roll 1d12+8 on the Helmets and Shields Table.
* Roll the rest as usual.

## Magic-User Classes

You are the Wizard, the Necromancer, the Elementalist, the Enchanter.
You are the scholar of the arcane, you handle spells and magic like no
one else.

**Wizard:** You have spent time in magic school and libraries, Your
knowledge is broad and you often now something about old and forgotten
things. You have a small magic creature as Familiar. You can
communicate with it telepathically as long as you can see it. If it
dies it can be re-summoned during an 8 hours ritual, you end up
Deprived. Your Grimlore starts with an additional spell.

**Necromancer:** You manipulate the forces of life and death and have a
sick attraction for undead creatures. You will be despised, banished,
or imprisoned in most settlements. You can speak with recently deceased
corpses, they will talk to you like a friend. Get 1 Fatigue at the end
of the conversation.

**Elementalist:** You summon the forces of the four elements: Water,
Earth, Fire and Air. You choose one element: You always have 3 Armor
against it and you can perform an elemental attack that does Enhanced
damage at the cost of 1 Fatigue.

**Bard:** You have sharpened your magic ability to charm and confuse. 
You can hypnotize an intelligent creature with an artistic performance. 
The creature is dazed and confused until a WIL Save is passed. Your 
Grimlore also contains knowledge of the arcane and history.

Character creation:

* Grimoire (Bulky). This is the fruit of your research and your most
precious belongings (only you can decipher it). You can spend four
hours to copy a standard Spellbook into your Grimoire followed by a
successful WIL Save. During this process the original Spellbook is
destroyed. Scrolls cannot be copied.
* All Magic-Users know 2 Cantrip spells.
* You are not comfortable wearing bulky armor. Spell casting wearing
one will cost 2 Fatigue.

Starting Gear:

* You start with your Grimoire with two random spells inscribed.
* Roll 1d6 on the Armor Table.
* Don’t roll on the Helmets and Shields Table.
* Roll the rest as usual.

## Thief Classes

You are the Rogue, the Assassin, the Ranger, the Tomb Robber. You are
the master of stealth, acrobatics and deception.

**Rogue:** The larcenous arts are your way of living, you have contacts
with the mob in most cities, You always hear the best rumors and nice
job proposals. You get cheap equipment from selected shops.
Nevertheless, Your reputation will not help you with the authorities
and you probably “wanted” somewhere. You know how to cut a purse and
you have learned the mysteries of lock-picking. As accomplished
burglars you can attempt to climb unthinkable sheer surfaces.

**Assassin:** You have learned many ways of killing, you are a deadly
shadow. You still owe your mentors, probably a guild, and beware of the
day they will hold you accountable. With the right ingredients you can
brew all kinds of poison. With some observations and study you can
create disguises that will fool detailed scrutiny.

**Ranger:** You are a protector of nature, you are a wilderness
survival expert and you know how to travel fast and unnoticed. Always
aware, you are rarely surprised. You have a semi intelligent faithful
pet of your choice. You have a deep connection with him/her and you
will always protect each other. Your pet will always find you back but
if it dies you will need to raise a cub.

**Tomb Robber:** You are stealing things from the dead, they don’t need
it after all. You are a specialist of underground exploration and
ancient structures. You feel at home in dark and damp places. You have
developed skills for disabling traps, only the most advanced one should
catch you. You can smell Undead creatures when they are close.

Character creation:

* Backstab: when you attack an unaware opponent from behind you do STR
damage.
* Read languages: you can read approximately any text.
* Swiftness: Once per round, a Thief may take an extra action at the
cost of 1 Fatigue.

Starting Gear:

* You start with an Expeditionary Gear and a Tool of your choice.
* Choose a Weapon.
* Roll the rest as usual.

## Knave

Knaves have no special abilities. Roll d20 for all gear.

## Making your own class.

You can re-theme once class to make another. For example, if you want
to be a Ranger that doesn't use an animal companion, simply use the
mechanics of a fighter. Or a Monk could be a Magic-User with a powerful
artifact instead of a grimlore. Or they could be a powerful combatitant
based on a Barbarian. A swordsman with an aincent powerful blade coould
use the mechanics of a Gladiator.

# Name, Background & Traits

First, choose or roll a **name** for your character from the Name &
Background tables, then their **background**, which informs their
knowledge and potential skills.

Next, roll for the rest of your character's **traits** (appearance,
speech, mannerisms, beliefs, reputation, etc.) on the *Character
Traits* tables.

## Ability Scores

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

**Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, and **Willpower (WIL)**. When
creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's
ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

**Example:** Ines rolls for her character's **STR**, resulting in a
**2**, a **4**, and a **6**, totaling **12**. The next two ability
rolls result in a **9** for **DEX** and a **13** for **WIL**. She
decides to swap the **12** and the **9**, for a character with **9
STR**, **12 DEX** and **13** **WIL**.

## Hit Protection

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting **Hit Protection** (HP), which
reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate
a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long
(see **Healing**). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the
player must roll on the **Scars** table.

## Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack with six
slots, one slot for each hand, and two slots for their upper body (such
as the belt, chest, or head). The backpack can also double as an
emergency sleeping bag but only if emptied of its contents.

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together.
Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Warden's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or
awkward to carry. Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10
slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A PC cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which
must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase
inventory. **Hirelings** can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with:

* Three days' rations (one slot)
* A torch (one slot)
* 3d6 gold pieces

Roll on the **Starting Gear** tables to determine your PC's armor,
weapons, tools, and equipment. If indicated, roll on the *Spellbooks*
table with a d100 (or roll 2d10, using one die as the ones place,and
one as the tens place).

See the **Equipment List** for related armor, damage, and slot values.
Smaller items can sometimes be bundled together into one slot.

If you would like something closer to traditional classes, refer to the
list of *Optional Gear Packages*.

# Rules

Each of the three **abilities** are used in different circumstances
(see **saves**, below).

**Strength (STR**): Used for saves requiring physical power, like
lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX):** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and
reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**Willpower (WIL):** Used for saves to persuade, deceive,
interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

**Saves**

A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and
circumstances. PCs roll a d20 for an appropriate ability score. If they
roll_equal to or under that ability score_, they pass. Otherwise, they
fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

If it is unclear which character should save in a situation, whomever
is in more danger should make the save.

**Example:** *Bea encounters a group of heavily-armed Goblins standing
guard before a tunnel entrance. Her player carefully plots a course,
recognizing that her 13 DEX makes sneaking past the guards the best
option. She rolls a d20, and resulting in a 10 – a success!*

**Advantage and Disadvantage**

A Warden has the option of modifiying the difficulty of saves using
**advantage** (where a character rolls two d20 and uses the higher
roll) or **disadvantage** (where a character rolls two d20 and uses the
lower roll).

**Deprivation & Fatigue**

A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is unable to
recover HP or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds
**Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies
one slot and lasts until they are able to recuperate (such as a full
night's rest in a safe spot).

PCs can also gain Fatigue by **casting spells** or through events in
the fiction.

Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP
but leaves the party exposed. Ability loss can usually be restored with
a week's rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of
expertise. Some of these services may be free, while more expedient or
magical means of recovery may come at a cost.

One level of ability loss can be restored if a player passes a
corresponding save after a rest.

**Armor**

Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Armor** value
from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provides a
bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn.

No one can have more than 3 Armor.

Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according
to their use.

**Reactions**

When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not
obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

* 2: Hostile
* 3-5: Wry
* 6-8: Curious
* 9-11: Kind
* 12: Helpful

**Morale**

Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their
first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups
may use their leader's WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save
when they're reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

**Wealth & Treasure**

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp), which is equal to 10
silver pieces (sp) and 100 copper pieces (cp).

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond
its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous
locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages,strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the
local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

## Magic

**Spellbooks** contain a single spell and take up one slot. They cannot
be transcribed or created; instead they are recovered from places like
tombs, dungeons, and manors.

Spellbooks sometimes display unusual properties or limitations, such as
producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate
intelligence,or being legible only when held in moonlight.

Spellbooks will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane
power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

**Scrolls** are similar to Spellbooks, however:

* They do not take up an inventory slot.
* They do not cause fatigue.
* They disappear after one use.

**Casting Spells**

Anyone can cast a spell by holding a Spellbook in both hands and
reading its contents aloud. They must then add a Fatigue to inventory,
occupying one slot. Given time and safety, PCs can_enhance_a spell
(e.g., affecting multiple targets, increasing its power, etc.) without
any additional cost. If the PC is deprived or in danger, the Warden may
require a PC to make a WIL save to avoid any ill-effects from casting
the spell. Consequences of failure are on par with the intended effect,
and may result in added Fatigue, the destruction of the Spellbook,
injury, and even death.

## Relics

**Relics** are items imbued with a magical spell or power. They do not
cause Fatigue. Relics usually have a limited use, as well as a recharge
condition. A few examples:

**Honeyclasp**, 3 charges. A rusted ring that shrinks the bearer to 6"
tall. Recharge: place in a thimble-sized cup of royal jelly.

**Falconer's Friend**, 1 charge. A bolt-shaped wand carrying the
Haste spell. Recharge: fire from a crossbow and recover.

**Staff of Silence**, 1 charge. This blackened rod temporarily
disables all magic within 50ft. Recharge: bathe in the light of a full
moon.

**Leycap**, 1 use. Anyone ingesting this green-flecked mushroom loses
a Fatigue, but is then required to make a WIL save to avoid its
addictive properties. A fail leaves the PC deprived and unable to focus
until they can eat another leycap, providing only a brief reprieve from
the addiction.

**Infinite Satchel** A bag known for holding things without regard to 
size, or weight, as long as it can fit through the opening of the 
satchel. No matter what the Satchel is holding, it's weight never 
increases.

# Combat

**Rounds**

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. In a fight or
circumstance where timing is helpful, use rounds to keep track of when
something occurs. A **round** is roughly ten seconds of in-game time
and is comprised of turns.

**Actions**

On their turn, a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one
action. This may be_casting a spell, attacking, making a second move,
or some other reasonable action.

Each round, the PCs declare what they are doing before dice are rolled.
If a character attempts something risky, the Warden calls for a save
for appropriate players or NPCs. All actions, attacks, and movements
take place simultaneously.

**Turns**

The Warden will telegraph the most likely actions taken by NPCs or
monsters. For the first round of combat, each PC must make a DEX save
to act. Then the opponents will act. Then all players (including
players that made their save to act first) will act. For the remainder
of combat, all players and then all opponents will take their turns
util the combat ends.

**Example:** *Bea has accidentally stumbled onto the stomping grounds
of a massive Wood Troll. In order to make a move before the Troll, she
makes a DEX save. She fails, and the Troll gets to attack first.*

**Attacking & Damage**

The attacker rolls their weapon die and subtracts the target's armor,
then deals the remaining total to their opponent's HP. Unarmed attacks
always do 1d4 damage.

**Example:** *The Wood Troll roars, swinging its club at Bea, who has 5
HP. The club does 1d10 damage and the Warden rolls a 4. They subtract 1
to account for Bea's leather armor, leaving Bea with 2 HP remaining.*

**Critical Hits**

It's fun to get critical hits. Even though every attack hits, it's
still fun to have a chance to crit. When you attack, roll a d20. On a
20, which allows you to take an extra action, make an extra attack, or
have your attack Enhanced.

In genereal, for saves you want to roll low, and for attacks and damage
you want to roll high.

Note that a **critical hit** does not necicarly cause **critical
damage.**

**Multiple Attackers**

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and
keep the single highest result, and add +1 to the damage for every
attacker to a target after the first.

**Attack Modifiers**

If fighting from a position of weakness (such as through cover or with
bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4
damage regardless of the attacks damage die.

If fighting from a position of advantage (such as against a helpless
foe or through a daring maneuver), the attack is **enhanced** ,
allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage instead of their normal die.

**Dual Weapons**

If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice
and keep the single highest result.

**Blast**

Attacks with the **blast** quality affect all targets in the noted
area, rolling separately for each affected character. Blast refers to
anything from explosions to huge cleaving onslaughts to the impact of a
meteorite. If unsure how many targets can be affected, roll the related
damage die for a result.

**Scars**

When damage to a PC reduces their HP to exactly 0, they are sometimes
changed irrevocably. See the **Scars** for more.

**Critical Damage**

Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's STR
by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid
**critical damage**. Additionally, some enemies will have special
abilities or effects that are triggered when their target fails a
critical damage save.

Any PC that suffers critical damage cannot do anything but crawl
weakly, grasping for life. If given aid and rest, they will stabilize.
If left untreated, they die within the hour.

**Ability Score Loss**

If a PC's STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0,
they are paralyzed. If their WIL is reduced to 0, they are delirious.

Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until
they are restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

**Unconsciousness & Death**

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or
take control of a hireling. They immediately join the party in order to
reduce downtime.

**Detachments**

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a
single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is
routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is
destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are impaired (excluding
blast damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are enhanced and deal blast
damage.

**Retreat**

Running away from a dire situation always requires a successful DEX
save, as well as a safe destination to run to.

## Advanced Combat Options

**Weapon Traits**

Below are some optional traits a magical or good quality weapon might
have. Sweep, parry, and reach are traits any weapon of that type can
have. Any of the other traits should be limited to 1 per rare, special,
or magic weapon.

Common Traits:

* Sweep: (2 handed weapons only) Make a second attack against an enemy
within reach if you roll for maximum damage or your attack reduces the
targets HP to zero or lower.
* Parry: (swords and daggers only) Melee damage of 1-2 is harmlessly
parried away.
* Reach: (polearms only) When attacked with a melee weapon without
reach, the attacker must roll half or higher on their damage roll or
else you get to attack them first.

Rare Traits:

* Enchanted: (magic weapons) Damage ignores armor.
* Brutal: (magic bludgeoning weapons; 2h only) Critical Damage
resulting from a Damage roll of 8 or more from this weapon is an
instant kill, and forces a morale Save on the enemy.
* Deadly: (magic weapons; rare) Re-roll on max damage and add to total.
* Vorpal: (magic blades; rare) Damage immediately bypasses HP, going
straight to STR and requiring a save against Critical Damage
* Blood-Thirsty: (cursed magic weapons; rare) On max damage, upgrade
dice type. 6>8>10. 10 on a d10 will reset the weapon to its base dice
and the weapon will need 2d6 hours to recharge. Should have some type
of curse or drawback.

Shield Trait:

* Shield Splintering: Players can opt to absorb all damage and effects
from an attack in exchange for their shield breaking.

**Magic Damage Types**

Below are some magic weapon damage types other than +1 damage.
Magic damage type on a weapon should lower it’s damage by 1 dice size
to account for the extra effect.

* Cold: On a hit, target makes a STR save or next attack is impaired.
* Thunder: On a hit, target makes a DEX save or can’t move next turn.
* Necrotic: On a hit, target makes a WIL save or loses next turn.
* Poison: On a hit, target makes a STR save or 1d4 damage for 1d4
rounds.
* Disintegration: On a hit, target makes a DEX save vs instant
obliteration and the wielder takes 1 fatigue. Exceptionally powerful
and rare.

**Special Materials**

Most weapons will be made from steel. Some special weapons, however,
could potentially come from different materials. Consider making a
weapon of a special material one dice size less to compensate for its
advantages.

* Cold-Iron: Heavy and prone to breaking. Enhanced vs. fey.
* Silver: Expensive. Enhanced vs. undead and certain monsters.
* Mithril: Elven alloy. Silvery-gold. Enhanced vs. goblins.
* Orichalcum: Dwarven alloy. Deep red-bronze. Enhanced vs. undead.
* Electrum: Magically forged alloy. Green-gold. Enhanced vs. demons.
* Meteor Ore: Rare star metal. Multi-hued. Enhanced vs. dragons.

**Scars**

When an attack reduces a PC's HP to exactly 0, they are uniquely
impacted. Look up the result on the table below based on the total
damage taken:

1. **Lasting Scar:** Roll 1d6 (1: Neck, 2: Hands, 3: Eye, 4: Chest,
5: Legs, 6: Ear). Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP,
take the new result.
2. **Rattling Blow:** You’re disoriented and shaken. Describe how you
refocus. Roll 1d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the
new result.
3. **Walloped:** You’re sent flying and land flat on your face, winded.
You are deprived until you rest for a few hours. Then, roll 1d6. Add
that amount to your max HP.
4. **Broken Limb:** Roll 1d6 (1-2: Leg, 3-4: Arm, 5: Rib, 6: Skull).
Once mended, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take
the new result.
5. **Diseased:** You’re afflicted with a gross, uncomfortable
infection. When you get over it, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than
your max HP, take the new result.
6. **Reorienting Head Wound:** Roll 1d6 (1-2: STR, 3-4: DEX, 5-6: WIL).
Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current ability score, take
the new result.
7. **Hamstrung:** You can barely move until you get serious help and
rest. After recovery, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max
DEX, take the new result.
8. **Deafened:** You cannot hear anything until you find extraordinary
aid. Regardless, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by
1d4.
9. **Re-brained:** Some hidden part of your psyche is knocked loose.
Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new
result.
10. **Sundered:** An appendage is torn off, crippled or useless. The
Warden will tell you which. Then, make a WIL save. If you pass,
increase your max WIL by 1d6.
11. **Mortal Wound:** You are deprived and out of action. You die in
one hour unless healed. Upon recovery, roll 2d6. Take the new result as
your max HP.
12. **Doomed:** Death seemed ever so close, but somehow you survived.
If your next save against critical damage is a fail, you die horribly.
If you pass, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take
the new result.

# Leveling Up

**Experience Points (XP)**

Gain a new level every 1,000 XP. Optionally increase the XP needed each
level. A good place to start is adding between 500-1,000 XP each level.

**Gaining XP**

Experience points are gained at a rate of 1 XP for every 1 gold (or
your game’s standard currency) retrieved and returned to the safety of
a town or your base of operations.

Optionally, characters can level up after playing a certain number of
adventures at their current level, and this number of adventures is
often some multiple of their current level. For example, if your
multiple was 5, a character would go from being level 2 to level 3
after playing about 10 adventures at level 2.

Increasing HP and Ability Scores each time you level up:

* Roll 1d6 and add to your HP total.
* Re-roll each Ability Score with 3d6. If a result is higher than your
current score, increase that Ability Score by 1.
* Players gain a point of **Perseverance** every level up, which can be
used to remove one **Fatigue**. **Perseverance** is restored when a
player rests to regain their fatigue.

## Bestiary

**Root Goblin:** 4 HP, 8 STR, 14 DEX, 8 WIL, spear (d6)

* Avoid combat unless they have the advantage (such as greater numbers).
* Guard their stolen goods to the death.
* Prize Spellbooks; willing to trade.

Spellbook (Choose one: Charm, Hypnotize, Push/Pull, Shield)

**Cobblehounds:** 12 HP, 2 Armor, 14 STR, 1 DEX, 8 WIL, bite (d10)

* Immobile constructs typically used as guardians to great tombs or
artifacts.

bone.

**Wood Troll:** 12 HP, 15 STR, 12 DEX, 7 WIL, claws and bite (d8+d8
blast)

* As an action, can recover lost HP.
* Critical damage: moss and twigs begin growing out of target's
wounds.

**Frost Elf:** 14 HP, 1 Armor, 8 STR, 13 DEX, 14 WIL, icicle dagger
(d6), a Spellbook (Choose one: Sleep, Teleport, Detect Magic)

## Creating Monsters

Use the following template to model any more sophisticated Monster or
NPC:

**Name:**

X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Weapon (dX, special
items, qualities)

* Engaging descriptor of appearance or demeanor
* Quirk, tactic, or peculiarity making this NPC unique
* Special effect or critical damage consequence

**General Principles**

Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is
noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.

* Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardy ones 6 HP, and serious
threats get 10+ HP.
* Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a
pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a
generic goblin archer.
* Use critical damage to lean into the threat or strangeness of any
aggressive NPC.
* Remember that HP is **Hit Protection** , not Hit Points. It's a
measure of resilience, luck, and gumption - not health.

**Converting from OSR Games**

* Give 1 HP per HD for most creatures.
* Most humanoids have at least 4HP.
* **Morale** can also be used as a baseline.
* Damage die are roughly the same, though armed attacks do at least 1d6
damage.

Some pointers:

* Is it good at avoiding a hit? Give it HP.
* Does it soak up damage? Give it Armor.
* Is it strong? Give it a high **STR**.
* Is it nimble? Give it high **DEX**.
* Is it charismatic? Give it high WIL.

This contains selections from Cairn Adventurer's Guide, The Hazard

# The Hazard System

## Hazard System (v0.3)

The six-sided hazard die deploys threats, manages resources such as
light, and keeps time. It is the engine that drives gameplay forward,
ensuring that choices have consequences while minimizing bookkeeping.
To take a turn, have a player roll the hazard die and have the referee
interpret the results relative to the current turn type. During a turn,
each player may take one full action. The general form of the hazard
die is:

1. Setback
2. Fatigue
3. Expiration
4. Locality
5. Percept
6. Advantage

## Hazard Die Interpretations

*d6. Result: Interpretation*

**Haven Turn Interpretation**

1. Setback: Encounter (use regional table) or disaster (see below)
2. Fatigue: Shortage (1 medicine, 2-3 drought, 4-5 famine, 6 trust)
3. Expiration: Clear one or more haven conditions
4. Locality: Advance season (or other local change)
5. Percept: Foreshadow looming disaster
6. Advantage: Full recovery

**Wilderness Turn Interpretation**

1. Setback: Encounter (use regional table) or road/bridge out
2. Fatigue: Rest and consume rations (1/person) or suffer minor harm
(1 HP)
3. Expiration: Expire transient wilderness condition
4. Locality: Shift weather (or other local change)
5. Percept: Spoor or clue regarding next encounter
6. Advantage: Free wilderness turn

**Dungeon Turn Interpretation**

1. Setback: Encounter (use zone table)
2. Fatigue: Rest and consume rations (1/party) or suffer minor harm
(1 HP)
3. Expiration: Expire transient dungeon conditions (light, spell, etc)
4. Locality: Shift dungeon state (or other local change)
5. Percept: Spoor or clue regarding next encounter
6. Advantage: Free dungeon turn

**Combat Turn Interpretation**

1. Setback: Opponents act first or additional encounter (use zone
table)
2. Fatigue: Suffer minor harm (1 HP) if engaged in melee
3. Expiration: Expire transient combat conditions (light, burning,
etc)
4. Locality: Shift battlefield (or other local change)
5. Percept: Spoor or clue regarding next encounter
6. Advantage: Free combat turn

* Some disasters (1d6): 1 invasion, 2 insurrection, 3 fire, 4
earthquake, 5 flood, 6 falling star
* Some dungeon localities (1d6): 1 obstruction, 2-3 seal/open door, 4-5
divert water, 6 expose secret
* Use common sense: ignore results that do not make fictional sense,
but only the first time
* Keep time abstract: quantifying the details precisely is rarely worth
the hassle

## Moves and Conditions

Moves represent actions relevant to the current fictional context, such
as exploring a trackless stretch of swamp. Conditions represent
persistence of a transient state, such as adventurer exhaustion.
Conditions can apply to areas, parties, or individuals. Strictness
tracking conditions is a matter of style. Tokens can help. The lists of
moves and conditions below below are suggestive rather than complete.
Improvise others as appropriate, according to referee ruling.

**Haven turns** represent several days or weeks of rest and recovery.

* Free haven moves: advance/level up, prepare spells, recover, recruit,
resupply
* Full haven moves: craft gear, scribe scroll, conduct research
* Haven conditions: curse, famine, pestilence, shortage, siege, winter

Wilderness turns represent travel and making camp, approximately one
day and night. Making a wilderness move requires consuming a ration or
taking the exhausted condition in addition to rolling the hazard die.
If already exhausted, at the start of a wilderness turn suffer minor
harm (1 HP). Determine randomly whether setbacks occur during day or
night.

* Free wilderness moves: access known landmark in current area, survey
adjacent areas
* Full wilderness moves: travel to adjacent area, search, explore,
hunt, track
* Wilderness conditions: exhausted, lost

Lost: Travel is no longer an option. Use search to locate a landmark,
removing the lost condition on success.

Dungeon turns represent exploration at architectural scale,
approximately tens of minutes or a few hours, assuming careful advance
into hostile places.

* Free dungeon moves: look under a rug, open unstuck door, pull lever
* Full dungeon moves: climb, force a door, move to adjacent area, pick
a lock, search
* Dungeon conditions: candlelight, torchlight, overburdened
Combat turns represent tactical actions occuring over seconds or
minutes.
* Free combat moves: shout command, drop held item,
* Full combat moves: shoot, spell, strike, throw, withdraw
* Combat conditions: burning, defended, grappled, prone

Notes and Further Reading

* Consider using a simple slot-based encumbrance system, such as one
item per point of strength.
* Locality results work best if you design areas with countdowns or
aspects that can shift between states.
* I replace traditional initiative with the combat hazard die.
