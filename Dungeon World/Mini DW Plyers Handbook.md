# Basic Moves

## Hack and Slash

When you **attack an enemy in melee**, roll+Str. ***On a 10+*** you 
deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, 
you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s 
attack. ***On a 7–9***, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy 
makes an attack against you.

## Volley

When you **take aim and shoot at an enemy at range**, roll+Dex. On a 
10+ you have a clear shot—deal your damage. ***On a 7–9***, choose one 
(whichever you choose you deal your damage):

* You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s 
choice.
* You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage.
* You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.

## Defy Danger

When you **act despite an imminent threat** or **suffer a calamity**, 
say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it: 

* by powering through, +Str
* by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
* by enduring, +Con
* with quick thinking, +Int
* through mental fortitude, +Wis
* using charm and social grace, +Cha

***On a 10+***, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to 
bear. ***On a 7–9***, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will 
offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

## Defend

When you **stand in defense of a person, item, or location** under 
attack, roll+Con. ***On a 10+***, hold 3. ***On a 7–9***, hold 1. So 
long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is 
attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:

* Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself.
* Halve the attack’s effect or damage.
* Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against 
the attacker.
* Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level.

## Spout Lore

When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about something**, 
roll+Int. ***On a 10+*** the GM will tell you something interesting and 
useful about the subject relevant to your situation. ***On a 7–9*** the 
GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it 
useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the 
truth, now.

## Discern Realities

When you **closely study a situation or person**, roll+Wis. ***On a 
10+*** ask the GM three questions from the list below. ***On a 7–9*** 
ask one. Take +1 forward when acting on the answers.

* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is useful or valuable to me?
* Who’s really in control here?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

## Parley

When you **you have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them**, 
roll+Cha. Leverage is something they need or want. ***On a 10+*** they 
ask you for something and do it if you make them a promise first. ***On 
a 7–9***, they need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

## Aid or Interfere

When you **help or hinder someone you have a bond with**, roll+Bond 
with them. ***On a 10+*** they take +1 or -2, your choice. ***On a 
7–9*** you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.

# Special Moves

## Last Breath

When **you’re dying** you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black 
Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just 
roll, +nothing—yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are). 
***On a 10+*** you’ve cheated death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re 
still alive. ***On a 7–9*** Death will offer you a bargain. Take it and 
stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate 
awaits you. On a miss, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s 
own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

## Encumbrance

When you **make a move while carrying weight** up to or equal to load, 
you’re fine. When you make a move while carrying weight equal to load+1 
or load+2, you take -1. When you make a move while carrying weight 
greater than load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll 
at -1, or automatically fail.

## Make Camp

When you **settle in to rest** consume a ration. If you’re somewhere 
dangerous decide the watch order as well. If you have enough XP you may 
Level Up. When you wake from at least a few uninterrupted hours of 
sleep heal damage equal to half your max HP.

## Take Watch

When you **you’re on watch and something approaches the camp** 
roll+Wis. ***On a 10+*** you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a 
response, the camp takes +1 forward. ***On a 7–9*** you react just a 
moment too late; the camp is awake but hasn’t had time to prepare. You 
have weapons and armor but little else. On a miss whatever lurks 
outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.

## Undertake a Perilous Journey

When you travel through hostile territory, choose one member of the 
party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be 
quartermaster (the same character cannot have two jobs). If you don’t 
have enough party members or choose not to assign a job, treat that job 
as if it had rolled a 6. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis. 
***On a 10+*** the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required 
by one. ***On a 10+*** the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it 
takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much). On a 10+ 
the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on 
it. ***On a 7–9*** each roles performs their job as expected: the 
normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long 
as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on 
them either.

## Level Up

When you **have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater 
than) your current level + 7**, subtract your current level +7 from 
your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new advanced move from 
your class. If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to 
your spellbook.

Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your 
modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and 
current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.

## End of Session

When you **reach the end of a session**, choose one your bonds that you 
feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or 
otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if 
they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you 
wish.

Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled 
that alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these 
three questions as a group:

* Did we learn something new and important about the world?
* Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
* Did we loot a memorable treasure?

For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.

## Carouse

When you **return triumphant and throw a big party**, spend 100 coin 
and roll + extra 100s of coin spent. ***On a 10+*** choose 3. ***On a 
7–9*** choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really 
out of hand.

* You befriend a useful NPC
* You hear rumors of an opportunity
* You gain useful information
* You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked

## Supply

When you **go to buy something with gold on hand**, if it’s something 
readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at market 
price. If it’s something special, beyond what’s usually available here, 
or non-mundane, roll+Cha. ***On a 10+*** you find what you’re looking 
for at a fair price. ***On a 7–9*** you’ll have to pay more or settle 
for something similar.

## Recover

When you **do nothing but rest in comfort and safety** after a day of 
rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one 
debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical 
or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.

## Recruit

When you **put out word that you’re looking to hire help**, roll. If 
you make it known

* that your pay is generous, take +1
* what you’re setting out to do, take +1
* that they’ll get a share of whatever you find, take +1

If you have a useful reputation around these parts take an additional 
+1. ***On a 10+*** you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled 
applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them 
along. ***On a 7–9*** you’ll have to settle for someone close or turn 
them away. On a miss someone influential and ill- suited declares 
they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a 
veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or 
turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to 
Recruit.

## Outstanding Warrants

When you **return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble 
before**, roll+Cha. ***On a 10+***, word has spread of your deeds and 
everyone recognizes you. ***On a 7–9***, that, and, the GM chooses a 
complication:

* The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest
* Someone has put a price on your head
* Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of 
your actions

## Bolster

When you **spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard 
practice,** you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or two, 1 
preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, 3 preparation. When 
your preparation pays off spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll. You 
can only spend one preparation per roll.

## Herculean Appetites

Others may content themselves with just a taste of wine, or dominion

pursuing one of your appetites if you would roll for a move, instead of 
rolling 2d6 you roll 1d6+1d8. If the d6 is the higher die of the pair,

taunting.

## [ ] Full Plate and Packing Steel

## [ ] Unencumbered, Unharmed

So long as you are below your Load and neither wear armor nor carry a 
shield, take +1 armor. Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Still Hungry: Choose an additional appetite.

* [ ] Appetite for Destruction: Take a move from the fighter, bard or 
thief class list. You may not take multiclass moves from those classes.

* [ ] My Love For You Is Like a Truck: When you perform a feat of 
strength, name someone present whom you have impressed and take +1 
forward to parley with them.

* [ ] What Is Best In Life: At the end of a session, if during this 
session you have crushed your enemies, seen them driven before you, or 
have heard the lamentations of their kinfolk mark XP. 

* [ ] Wide Wanderer: You’ve traveled the wide world over. When you 
arrive someplace ask the GM about any important traditions, rituals, 
and so on, they’ll tell you what you need to know.

* [ ] Usurper: When you prove yourself superior to a person in power, 
take +1 forward with their followers, underlings, and hangers on. Khan 
of 

* [ ] Khans: Your hirelings always accept the gratuitous fulfillment of 
one of your appetites as payment.

* [ ] Samson: You may take a debility to immediately break free of any 
physical or mental restraint.

* [ ] Smash!: When you hack and slash, on a 12+ deal your damage and 
choose something physical your target has (a weapon, their position, a 
limb): they lose it.

* [ ] Indestructible Hunger: When you take damage you can choose to 
take -1 ongoing until you sate one of your appetites instead of taking 
the damage. If you already have this penalty you cannot choose this 
option.

* [ ] Eye for Weakness: When you discern realities add “What here is 
weak or vulnerable?” to the list of questions you can ask.

* [ ] On the Move: When you defy a danger caused by movement (maybe 
falling off a narrow bridge or rushing past an armed guard) take +1.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level 
2–5 moves.

* [ ] A Good Day to Die: As long as you have less than your Con in 
current HP (or 1, whichever is higher) take +1 ongoing.

* [ ] Kill ‘em All (Requires: Appetite for Destruction): Take another 
move from the fighter, bard or thief class list. You may not take 
multiclass moves from those classes.

* [ ] War Cry: When you enter battle with a show of force (a shout, a 
rallying cry, a battle dance) roll+Cha. ***On a 10+*** both, ***On a 
7–9*** one or the other. 1) Your allies are rallied and take +1 
forward. 2) Your enemies feel fear and act accordingly (avoiding you, 
hiding, attacking with fear driven abandon)

* [ ] Mark of Might: When you take this move and spend some 
uninterrupted time reflecting on your past glories you may mark 
yourself with a symbol of your power (a long braid tied with bells, 
ritual scars or tattoos, etc.) Any intelligent mortal creature who sees 
this symbol knows instinctively that you are a force to be reckoned 
with and treats you appropriately.

* [ ] More! Always More!: When you satisfy an appetite to the extreme 
(destroying something unique and significant, gaining enormous fame, 
riches, power, etc.) you may choose to resolve it. Cross it off the 
list and mark XP. While you may pursue that appetite again, you no 
longer feel the burning desire you once did. In its place, choose a new 
appetite from the list or write your own.

* [ ] The One Who Knocks: When you defy danger, on a 12+ you turn the 
danger back on itself, the GM will describe how.

* [ ] Healthy Distrust: Whenever the unclean magic wielded by mortal 
men causes you to defy danger, treat any result of 6 as a 7–9.

* [ ] For the Blood God: You are initiated in the old ways, the ways of 
sacrifice. Choose something your gods (or the ancestor spirits, or your 
totem, etc) value—gold, blood, bones or the like. When you sacrifice 
those things as per your rites and rituals, roll+Wis. ***On a 10+*** 
the GM will grant you insight into your current trouble or a boon to 
help you. ***On a 7–9*** the sacrifice is not enough and your gods take 
of your flesh as well, but still grant you some insight or boon. ***On 
a miss***, you earn the ire of the fickle spirits.

undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act 
as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from 
afar. They’re clever like that.

## Commune

When you **spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion 
with your deity**, you:

* Lose any spells already granted to you.
* Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed 
your own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than your own 
level.
* Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell

When you **unleash a spell granted to you by your deity**, roll+Wis. 
***On a 10+***, the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not 
revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. ***On a 7–9***, the spell 
is cast, but choose one:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will 
tell you how.
* Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to cast a 
spell until the next time you commune.
* After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot 
cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause 
a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Chosen One: Choose one spell. You are granted that spell as if it 
was one level lower.

* [ ] Invigorate: When you **heal someone** they take +2 forward to 
their damage.

* [ ] The Scales of Life and Death: When **someone takes their last 
breath in your presence**, they take +1 to the roll.

* [ ] Serenity: When you cast a spell you ignore the first -1 penalty 
from ongoing spells.

* [ ] First Aid: Cure Light Wounds is a rote for you, and therefore 
doesn’t count against your limit of granted spells.

* [ ] Divine Intervention: When you commune you get 1 hold and lose any 
hold you already had. Spend that hold when you or an ally takes damage 
to call on your deity, they intervene with an appropriate manifestation 
(a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light) and negate the 
damage.

* [ ] Penitent: When you **take damage and embrace the pain**, you may 
take +1d4 damage (ignoring armor). If you do, take +1 forward to cast a 
spell.

* [ ] Empower: When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the option of 
choosing from the 7–9 list. If you do, you may choose one of these 
effects as well: 1) The spell’s effects are doubled. 2) The spell’s 
targets are doubled.

* [ ] Orison for Guidance: When you **sacrifice something of value to 
your deity and pray for guidance**, your deity tells you what it would 
have you do. If you do it, mark experience.

* [ ] Divine Protection: When you wear no armor or shield you get 2 
armor.

* [ ] Devoted Healer: When you heal someone else of damage, add your 
level to the amount of damage healed.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level 
2–5 moves.

* [ ] Anointed (Requires: Chosen One): Choose one spell in addition to 
the one you picked for chosen one. You are granted that spell as if it 
was one level lower.

* [ ] Apotheosis: The first time you **spend time in prayer as 
appropriate to your god** after taking this move, choose a feature 
associated with your deity (rending claws, wings of sapphire feathers, 
an all-seeing third eye, etc.). When you emerge from prayer, you 
permanently gain that physical feature.

* [ ] Reaper: When you **take time after a conflict to dedicate your 
victory to your deity and deal with the dead**, take +1 forward.

* [ ] Providence (Replaces: Serenity): You ignore the -1 penalty from 
two spells you maintain.

* [ ] Greater First Aid (Requires: First Aid): Cure Moderate Wounds is 
a rote for you, and therefore doesn’t count against your limit of 
granted spells.

* [ ] Divine Invincibility (Replaces: Divine Intervention): When you 
commune you gain 2 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that 
hold when you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, who 
intervenes with an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a 
lucky slip, a burst of light) and negates the damage.

* [ ] Martyr (Replaces: Penitent): When you **take damage and embrace 
the pain**, you may take +1d4 damage (ignoring armor). If you do, take 
+1 forward to cast a spell and add your level to any damage done or 
healed by the spell.

* [ ] Divine Armor (Replaces: Divine Protection): When you wear no 
armor or shield you get 3 armor.

* [ ] Greater Empower (Replaces: Empower): When you cast a spell, on a 
10–11 you have the option of choosing from the 7–9 list. If you do, you 
may choose one of these effects as well. On a 12+ you get to choose one 
of these effects for free: 1) The spell’s effects are doubled. 2) The 
spell’s targets are doubled.

* [ ] Multiclass Dabbler: Get one move from another class. Treat your 
level as one lower for choosing the move.

# Cleric Spells

## Rotes

Every time you commune, you gain access to all of your rotes without 
having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.

* Light Rote: An item you touch glows with divine light, about as 
bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel 
but is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the 
color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

* Sanctify Rote: Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast 
this spell is consecrated by your deity. In addition to now being holy 
or unholy, the affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage.

* Guidance Rote: The symbol of your deity appears before you and 
gestures towards the direction or course of action your deity would 
have you take then disappears. The message is through gesture only; 
your communication through this spell is severely limited.

## Level 1 Spells

* [ ] Bless (Level 1 *Ongoing*): Your deity smiles upon a combatant of 
your choice. They take +1 ongoing so long as battle continues and they 
stand and fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a 
spell.

* [ ] Cure Light Wounds (Level 1): At your touch wounds scab and bones 
cease to ache. Heal an ally you touch of 1d8 damage.

* [ ] Detect Alignment (Level 1): When you cast this spell choose an 
alignment: Good, Evil, Lawful, or Chaotic. One of your senses is 
briefly able to detect that alignment. The GM will tell you what here 
is of that alignment.

* [ ] Cause Fear (Level 1 *Ongoing*): Choose a target you can see and a 
nearby object. The target is afraid of the object so long as you 
maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to them: flee, panic, beg, 
fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. You 
cannot target entities with less than animal intelligence (magical 
constructs, undead, automatons, and the like).

* [ ] Magic Weapon (Level 1 *Ongoing*): The weapon you hold while 
casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss this spell. While this spell 
is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Sanctuary (Level 1): As you cast this spell, you walk the 
perimeter of an area, consecrating it to your deity. As long as you 
stay within that area you are alerted whenever someone acts with malice 
within the sanctuary (including entering with harmful intent). Anyone 
who receives healing within a sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.

* [ ] Speak With Dead (Level 1): A corpse converses with you briefly. 
It will answer any three questions you pose to it to the best of the 
knowledge it had in life and the knowledge it gained in death.

## Level 3 Spells

* [ ] Animate Dead (Level 3 *Ongoing*): You invoke a hungry spirit to 
possess a recently-dead body and serve you. This creates a zombie that 
follows your orders to the best of its limited abilities. Treat the 
zombie as a character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has 
a +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The zombie lasts until it is 
destroyed by taking damage in excess of its HP, or until you end the 
spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. The 
zombie also gets your choice of 1d4 of these traits: 1) It’s talented. 
Give one stat a +2 modifier. 2) It’s durable. It has +2 HP for each 
level you have. 3) It has a functioning brain and can complete complex 
tasks. 4) It does not appear obviously dead, at least for a day or two.

* [ ] Cure Moderate Wounds (Level 3): You staunch bleeding and set 
bones through magic. Heal an ally you touch of 2d8 damage.

* [ ] Darkness (Level 3 *Ongoing*): Choose an area you can see: it’s 
filled with supernatural darkness and shadow. While this spell is 
ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Resurrection (Level 3): Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a 
corpse whose soul has not yet fully departed this world. Resurrection 
is always possible, but the GM will give you one or more (possibly all) 
of these conditions to fulfill. The GM may, depending on the 
circumstances, allow you to resurrect the corpse now, with the 
understanding that the conditions must be met before it’s permanent, or 
require you to meet the conditions before the corpse is resurrected. 1) 
It’s going to take days/weeks/months. 2) You must get help from 
\_______________. 3) It will require a lot of money. 4) You must 
sacrifice \_______________ to do it.

* [ ] Hold Person (Level 3): Choose a person you can see. Until you 
cast a spell or leave their presence they cannot act except to speak. 
This effect ends immediately if the target takes damage from any 
source.

## Level 5 Spells

* [ ] Revelation (Level 5): Your deity answers your prayers with a 
moment of perfect understanding. The GM will shed light on the current 
situation. When acting on the information, you take +1 forward.

* [ ] Cure Critical Wounds (Level 5): Heal an ally you touch of 3d8 
damage.

* [ ] Divination (Level 5): Name a person, place, or thing you want to 
learn about. Your deity grants you visions of the target, as clear as 
if you were there.

* [ ] Contagion (Level 5 *Ongoing*): Choose a creature you can see. 
Until you end this spell, the target suffers from a disease of your 
choice. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Words of the Unspeaking (Level 5): With a touch you speak to the 
spirits within things. The non-living object you touch answers three 
questions you pose, as best it can.

* [ ] True Seeing (Level 5 *Ongoing*): Your vision is opened to the 
true nature of everything you lay your eyes on. You pierce illusions 
and see things that have been hidden. The GM will describe the area 
before you ignoring any illusions and falsehoods, magical or otherwise. 
While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Trap Soul (Level 5): You trap the soul of a dying creature within 
a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still 
be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves 
against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any 
time but it can never be recaptured once freed.

## Level 7 Spells

* [ ] Word of Recall (Level 7): Choose a word. The first time after 
casting this spell that you speak the chosen word, you and any allies 
touching you when you cast the spell are immediately returned to the 
exact spot where you cast the spell. You can only maintain a single 
location; casting Word of Recall again before speaking the word 
replaces the earlier spell.

* [ ] Heal (Level 7): Touch an ally and you may heal their damage a 
number of points up to your maximum HP.

* [ ] Harm (Level 7): Touch an enemy and strike them with divine 
wrath—deal 2d8 damage to them and 1d6 damage to yourself. This damage 
ignores armor.

* [ ] Sever (Level 7 *Ongoing*): Choose an appendage on the target such 
as an arm, tentacle, or wing. The appendage is magically severed from 
their body, causing no damage but considerable pain. Missing an 
appendage may, for example, keep a winged creature from flying, or a 
bull from goring you on its horns. While this spell is ongoing you take 
-1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Mark of Death (Level 7): Choose a creature whose true name you 
know. This spell creates permanent runes on a target surface that will 
kill that creature, should they read them.

* [ ] Control Weather (Level 7): Pray for rain—or sun, wind, or snow. 
Within a day or so, your god will answer. The weather will change 
according to your will and last a handful of days.

## Level 9 Spells

* [ ] Storm of Vengeance (Level 9): Your deity brings the unnatural 
weather of your choice to pass. Rain of blood or acid, clouds of souls, 
wind that can carry away buildings, or any other weather you can 
imagine: ask and it shall come.

* [ ] Repair (Level 9): Choose one event in the target’s past. All 
effects of that event, including damage, poison, disease, and magical 
effects, are ended and repaired. HP and diseases are healed, poisons 
are neutralized, magical effects are ended.

* [ ] Divine Presence (Level 9 *Ongoing*): Every creature must ask your 
leave to enter your presence, and you must give permission aloud for 
them to enter. Any creature without your leave takes an extra 1d10 
damage whenever they take damage in your presence. While this spell is 
ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Consume Unlife (Level 9): The mindless undead creature you touch 
is destroyed and you steal its death energy to heal yourself or the 
next ally you touch. The amount of damage healed is equal to the HP 
that the creature had remaining before you destroyed it.

* [ ] Plague Level (9 *Ongoing*): Name a city, town, encampment, or 
other place where people live. As long as this spell is active that 
place is beset by a plague appropriate to your deity’s domains 
(locusts, death of the first born, etc.) While this spell is ongoing 
you take -1 to cast a spell.

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Born of the Soil

You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient 
and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go, 
they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of 
the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when 
shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in 
your Land.

* [ ] The Great Forests
* [ ] The Whispering Plains
* [ ] The Vast Desert
* [ ] The Stinking Mire
* [ ] The River Delta
* [ ] The Depths of the Earth
* [ ] The Sapphire Islands
* [ ] The Open Sea
* [ ] The Towering Mountains
* [ ] The Frozen North
* [ ] The Blasted Wasteland

Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the 
soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature 
like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like 
leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what 
shape you take.

## By Nature Sustained

You don’t need to eat or drink. If a move tells you to mark off a 
ration just ignore it.

## Spirit Tongue

The grunts, barks, chirps, and calls of the creatures of the wild are 
as language to you. You can understand any animal native to your land 
or akin to one whose essence you have studied.

## Shapeshifter

When you call upon the spirits to change your shape, roll+Wis. ***On a 
10+*** hold 3. ***On a 7–9*** hold 2. ✴On a miss hold 1 in addition to 
whatever the GM says.

You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have 
studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a 
perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and 
weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of 
air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to 
trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM 
will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. 
Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to 
your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert 
to your natural form.

## Studied Essence

When you **spend time in contemplation of an animal spirit**, you may 
add its species to those you can assume using shapeshifting.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Hunter’s Brother: Choose one move from the ranger class list.

* [ ] Red of Tooth and Claw: When you **are in an appropriate animal 
form** (something dangerous) increase your damage to d8.

* [ ] Communion of Whispers: When **you spend time in a place, making 
note of its resident spirits and calling on the spirits of the land**, 
roll+Wis. You will be granted a vision of significance to you, your 
allies, and the spirits around you. ***On a 10+*** the vision will be 
clear and helpful to you. ***On a 7–9*** the vision is unclear, its 
meaning murky. ✴On a miss, the vision is upsetting, frightening, or 
traumatizing. The GM will describe it. Take -1 forward.

* [ ] Barkskin: So long as your feet touch the ground you have +1 
armor.

* [ ] Eyes of the Tiger: When you mark an animal (with mud, dirt, or 
blood) you can see through that animal’s eyes as if they were your own, 
no matter what distance separates you. Only one animal at a time may be 
marked in this way.

* [ ] Shed: When you **take damage while shapeshifted** you may choose 
to revert to your natural form to negate the damage.

* [ ] Thing-Talker: You see the spirits in the sand, the sea and the 
stone. You may now apply your spirit tongue, shapeshifting and studied 
essence to inanimate natural objects (plants and rocks) or creatures 
made thereof, as well as animals. Thing- talker forms can be exact 
copies or can be mobile vaguely humanoid-shaped entities.

* [ ] Formcrafter: When you shapeshift choose a stat: you take +1 
ongoing to rolls using that stat while shifted. The GM will choose a 
stat, too: you take -1 ongoing to rolls using that stat while shifted.

* [ ] Elemental Mastery: When you **call on the primal spirits of fire, 
water, earth or air to perform a task for you** 1) The effect you 
desire comes to pass. 2) You avoid paying nature’s price. 3) You retain 
control. roll+Wis. ***On a 10+*** choose two. ***On a 7–9*** choose 
one. ✴On a miss, some catastrophe occurs as a result of your calling. 

* [ ] Balance: When you **deal damage**, take 1 balance. When you touch 
someone and channel the spirits of life you may spend balance. For each 
balance spent, heal 1d4 HP.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level 
2–5 moves.

* [ ] Embracing No Form: When you shapeshift, roll 1d4 and add that 
total to your hold.

* [ ] Doppelgänger’s Dance: You are able to study the essence of 
specific individuals to take their exact form, including men, elves, or 
the like. Suppressing your tell is possible, but if you do, take -1 
ongoing until you return to your own form.

* [ ] Blood and Thunder (Replaces: Red of Tooth and Claw): When you 
**are in an appropriate animal form** (something dangerous) increase 
your damage to d10.

* [ ] The Druid Sleep: When you take this move, the next opportunity 
that you have safety and time to spend in an appropriate location, you 
may attune yourself to a new land. This effect occurs only once and the 
GM will tell you how long it will take and what cost you must pay. From 
then on, you are considered to be born of the soil in both lands.

* [ ] World-Talker (Requires: Thing-Talker): You see the patterns that 
make up the fabric of the world. You may now apply your spirit tongue, 
shapeshifter and studied essence moves to pure elements—fire, water, 
air and earth.

* [ ] Stalker’s Sister: Choose one move from the ranger class list.

* [ ] Formshaper (Requires: Formcrafter): You may increase your armor 
by 1 or deal an additional +1d4 damage while in an animal form. Choose 
which when you shapeshift.

* [ ] Chimera: When you shapeshift, you may create a merged form of up 
to three different shapes. You may be a bear with the wings of an eagle 
and the head of a ram, for example. Each feature will grant you a 
different move to make. Your chimera form follows the same rules as 
shapeshifter otherwise.

* [ ] Weather Weaver: When you are under open skies when the sun rises 
the GM will ask you what the weather will be that day. Tell them 
whatever you like, it comes to pass.

## Gear

you. You begin with a symbol of your sacrifices past, Adventuring Gear 
(5 uses, 1 weight) and 1 healing potion. Then choose two:

* [ ] Dungeon Rations (5 uses, 1 weight)
* [ ] 1 Healing Potion (0 weight)
* [ ] 10 coins

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Burning Brand

When you conjure a weapon of pure flame. You may use STR or DEX when 
you attack. The weapon always begins with the fiery, touch, dangerous, 
and hold 3. Each attack with the weapon consumes one hold. Roll+CON. 
***On a 10+*** choose two of the following tags, ***On a 7-9*** choose 
one.

* [ ] hand
* [ ] thrown, near
* [ ] +1 damage
* [ ] remove the dangerous tag

## Fighting Fire With Fire

When you take damage, and that damage is odd (after armor) the flames 
within you come to your aid. Roll 1d4 and either add that many uses to 
your burning brand (if active), take that result forward to summon your 
burning brand, or reduce the damage by that amount, your choice.

## Control Flame

When you bend non-magical flame to your will, roll+WIS. ***On a 10+*** 
it does as you command, taking the shape and movement you desire for as 
long as it has fuel on which to burn. ***On a 7-9*** the effect is 
short-lived, lasting only a moment.

## Personal Incandescence 

When you gaze intensely into someone eyes, you may ask their player 
“what fuels the flames of your desire?” Roll+CHA. ***On a 10+*** 
they’ll answer with the truth, even if the character does not know or 
would otherwise keep this hidden. ***On a 7-9*** they will answer, but 
you are also compelled to answer.

## Hand Crafted

You may use your hands in place of tools and fire 
to craft metal objects. Mundane weapons, armor and metal jewelry can 
all be formed from their raw components. You may unmake these things, 
as well, but to do so without time and safety might require that you 
Defy Danger first.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Lore of Flame: When you stare into a source of fire, looking for 
answers, roll+WIS ***On a 10+***, the GM will tell you something new 
and interesting about the current situation. On a 10+, the GM will give 
you good detail. ***On a 7–9***, the GM will give you an impression. If 
you already know all there is to know, the GM will tell you that.

* [ ] Burns Twice as Bright: When you channel the flames of fate, you 
may treat a missed roll as a 7-9 or a 7-9 result as a 10+. This may be 
a roll you or another character has made. Tell the GM something you’ve 
lost; an emotion, a memory or some innate piece of your being. You may 
not use this move again until you’ve used Burns Half As Long.

* [ ] Burns Half as Long: You gain this move when you gain Burns Twice 
as Bright. When you sacrifice a victory to the flames of fate, treat 
any roll of 10+ as a miss. 

* [ ] This Killing Fire: Add the following tags to your options for 
Burning Brand: messy, forceful, reach, near, far.

* [ ] Firebrand: When you introduce a new idea to an NPC, roll+CHA. 
***On a 10+*** They believe the idea to be their own and take to it 
with fervor ***On a 7-9***, Their passion fades after a day or two. On 
a miss, they respond negatively, speaking out against the idea.

* [ ] Ogdru Jahad: Gain the Wizard move Ritual. The GM will always tell 
you what you have to sacrifice to gain the effect you desire.

* [ ] Moth to the Flame: When you tempt a weak mind with your inner 
fire, roll+WIS. ***On a 10+*** their will is suppressed, they’ll follow 
you and do as you desire, so long as nothing startles or surprises 
them. ***On a 7-9***, the effect is only strong enough to distract or 
confuse them. On a miss, they become agitated and upset, your fire 
having sparked their hidden desires.

* [ ] Burning Bridges: When you would take your last breath, 
roll+Bonds. ***On a 10+*** you don't have to roll Last Breath. You may 
erase one of your Bonds. This is permanent and lowers your total 
available Bonds forever. You are alive and have 1d6 hp. ***On a 7-9***, 
you must roll Last Breath, but take a +1. ***On a 6-*** take your last 
breath as normal.

* [ ] The Enkindler: When you bolster the courage of others roll+CHA. 
***On a 10+*** they shake off all fear and doubt, becoming brave in an 
instant. ***On a 7-9***, this effect is fleeting, they realize its 
superficiality and resort to cowardice after a moment or two. On a 
miss, they’re cowed or terrified by your presence.

* [ ] Sick Burn: When you insult an NPC, roll + CHA. ***On a 10+*** you 
leave them no room to react, they bear your insult and the scorn of all 
who hear it. ***On a 7-9*** you cross a line, they will have their 
revenge, someday. On a miss you’ve gone too far, they blow up here and 
now.

When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level 
2-5 moves.

* [ ] From Hell’s Heart: Whenever you summon fire with any of your 
moves, you can replace it with the black fires of hell itself. This 
fire does not burn with heat and ignores armor, scorching the soul 
itself. Those creatures without souls cannot be harmed by this type of 
flame.

* [ ] Burning Ring Of Fire: When you fuse a willing person’s soul to 
yours, roll+CHA. ***On a 10+*** you are bound together, able to sense 
each other at any distance, as well as sharing your emotional state. 
***On a 7-9***, the connection is unstable and dangerous, when you take 
a debility, so do they (and vice versa). ***On a 6-***, the branding is 
rejected and you both erase any Bonds you have to each other. You may 
write new Bonds with them at the End of Session as usual. This fusion, 
once performed, cannot be undone by mortal means.

* [ ] Fanning the Flames (Requires: Firebrand): You may apply the 
effects of your Firebrand move to a group of people -- a dozen or so -- 
all at once.

* [ ] Watch the World Burn: When you open a channel to the burning 
planes and call a firestorm, tell the GM what you’re sacrificing and 
roll+WIS. The sky opens up and fire pours like rain from it within an 
area about equal to a small village. Everyone and everything in the 
area takes damage as appropriate. ***On a 10+*** you can extinguish the 
storm with a little effort. ***On a 7-9*** the fires rage out of your 
control, spreading and gusting where they are carried by wind and 
weather. On a miss, something cruel, intelligent and hungry comes with 
the storm.

* [ ] Shoot First: You’re never caught by surprise. When an enemy would 
get the drop on you, you get to act first instead.

* [ ] Poison Master: After you’ve used a poison once it’s no longer 
dangerous for you to use.

* [ ] Envenom: You can apply even complex poisons with a pinprick. When 
you apply a poison that’s not dangerous for you to use to your weapon 
it’s touch instead of applied.

* [ ] Brewer: When you have time to gather materials and a safe place 
to brew you can create three doses of any one poison you’ve used 
before.

* [ ] Underdog: When you’re outnumbered, you have +1 armor.

* [ ] Connections: When you put out word to the criminal underbelly 
about something you want or need, roll+CHA. ***On a 10+***, someone has 
it, just for you. ***On a 7–9***, you’ll have to settle for something 
close or it comes with strings attached, your call.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level 
2–5 moves.

* [ ] Dirty Fighter (Replaces: Cheap Shot): When using a precise or 
hand weapon, your backstab deals an extra +1d8 damage and all other 
attacks deal +1d4 damage.

* [ ] Extremely Cautious (Replaces: Cautious): When you use trap expert 
you always get +1 hold, even on a 6-. On a 12+ you get 3 hold and the 
next time you come near a trap the GM will immediately tell you what it 
does, what triggers it, who set it, and how you can use it to your 
advantage.

* [ ] Alchemist (Replaces: Brewer): When you have you have time to 
gather materials and a safe place to brew you can create three doses of 
any poison you’ve used before. Alternately you can describe the effects 
of a poison you’d like to create. The GM will tell you that you can 
create it, but with one or more caveats: 1) It will only work under 
specific circumstances. 2) The best you can manage is a weaker version. 
3) It’ll take a while to take effect. 4) It’ll have obvious side 
effects.

* [ ] Serious Underdog (Replaces: Underdog): You have +1 armor. When 
you’re outnumbered, you have +2 armor instead.

* [ ] Evasion: When you defy danger on a 12+, you transcend the danger. 
You not only do what you set out to, but the GM will offer you a better 
outcome, true beauty, or a moment of grace.

* [ ] Strong Arm, True Aim: You can throw any melee weapon, using it to 
volley. A thrown melee weapon is gone; you can never choose to reduce 
ammo on a 7–9.

* [ ] Escape Route: When you’re in too deep and need a way out, name 
your escape route and roll+DEX. ***On a 10+*** [ ] you’re gone. ***On a 
7–9*** [ ] you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave 
something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.

* [ ] Disguise: When you have time and materials you can create a 
disguise that will fool anyone into thinking you’re another creature of 
about the same size and shape. Your actions can give you away but your 
appearance won’t.

* [ ] Heist: When you take time to make a plan to steal something, name 
the thing you want to steal and ask the GM these questions. When acting 
on the answers you and your allies take +1 forward. (Who will notice 
it’s missing? What’s its most powerful defense? Who will come after it? 
Who else wants it?)

Choose your weapon:

* [ ] Dagger (hand, 1 weight)
* [ ] Staff (close, two-handed, 1 weight)

Choose one:

* [ ] Healing potion (0 weight)
* [ ] 3 antitoxins (0 weight)

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Spellbook

You have mastered several spells and inscribed them in your spellbook. 
You start out with three first level spells in your spellbook as well 
as the cantrips. Whenever you gain a level, you add a new spell of your 
level or lower to your spellbook. You spellbook is 1 weight.

## Prepare Spells

When you **spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet 
contemplation of your spellbook**, you:

* Lose any spells you already have prepared
* Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total 
levels don’t exceed your own level+1.
* Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell (Int)

When you **release a spell you’ve prepared**, roll+Int. ***On a 10+***, 
the spell is successfully cast and you do not forget the spell—you may 
cast it again later. ***On a 7-9***, the spell is cast, but choose one:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will 
tell you how.
* The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1 
ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
* After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell 
again until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause 
a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

## Spell Defense

You may end any ongoing spell immediately and use the energy of its 
dissipation to deflect an oncoming attack. The spell ends and you 
subtract its level from the damage done to you.

## Ritual

When you **draw on a place of power to create a magical effect**, tell 
the GM what you’re trying to achieve. Ritual effects are always 
possible, but the GM will give you one to four of the following 
conditions:

* It’s going to take days/weeks/months.
* First you must \_______________.
* You’ll need help from \_______________.
* It will require a lot of money.
* The best you can do is a lesser version, unreliable and limited.
* You and your allies will risk danger from \_______________.
* You’ll have to disenchant \_______________  to do it.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves. You also add a 
new spell to your spellbook at each level.

* [ ] Prodigy: Choose a spell. You prepare that spell as if it were one 
level lower.

* [ ] Empowered Magic: When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the 
option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may choose one of 
these as well: 1) The spell’s effects are maximized. 2) The spell’s 
targets are doubled.

* [ ] Fount of Knowledge: When you **spout lore about something no one 
else has any clue about**, take +1.

* [ ] Know-It-All: When **another player’s character comes to you for 
advice and you tell them what you think is best**, they get +1 forward 
when following your advice and you mark experience if they do.

* [ ] Expanded Spellbook: Add a new spell from the spell list of any 
class to your spellbook.

* [ ] Enchanter: When you have time and safety with a magic item you 
may ask the GM what it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

* [ ] Logical: When you **use strict deduction to analyze your 
surroundings**, you can discern realities with INT instead of WIS.

* [ ] Arcane Ward: As long as you have at least one prepared spell of 
first level or higher, you have +2 armor.

* [ ] Counterspell: When you **attempt to counter an arcane spell that 
will otherwise affect you**, stake one of your prepared spells on the 
defense and roll+Int. ***On a 10+***, the spell is countered and has no 
effect on you. ***On a 7-9***, the spell is countered and you forget 
the spell you staked. Your counterspell protects only you; if the 
countered spell has other targets they get its effects.

* [ ] Quick Study: When you **see the effects of an arcane spell**, ask 
the GM the name of the spell and its effects. You take +1 when acting 
on the answers.

When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level 2-5
moves.

* [ ] Master (Requires: Prodigy): Choose one spell in addition to the 
one you picked for prodigy. You prepare that spell as if it were one 
level lower.

* [ ] Greater Empowered Magic (Replaces: Empowered Magic): When you 
cast a spell, on a 10-11 you have the option of choosing from the 7-9 
list. If you do, you may choose one of these effects as well. On a 12+ 
you get to choose one of these effects for free: 1) The spell’s effects 
are doubled. 2) The spell’s targets are doubled.

* [ ] Enchanter’s Soul (Requires: Enchanter): When you have time and 
safety with a magic item in a place of power you can empower that item 
so that the next time you use it its effects are amplified, the GM will 
tell you exactly how.

* [ ] Highly Logical (Replaces: Logical): When you **use strict 
deduction to analyze your surroundings**, you can discern realities 
with Int instead of Wis. On a 12+ you get to ask the GM any three 
questions, not limited by the list.

* [ ] Arcane Armor (Replaces: Arcane Ward): As long as you have at 
least one prepared spell of first level or higher, you have +4 armor.

* [ ] Protective Counter (Requires: Counterspell): When an ally within 
sight of you is affected by an arcane spell, you can counter it as if 
it affected you. If the spell affects multiple allies you must counter 
for each ally separately.

* [ ] Ethereal Tether: When you have time with a willing or helpless 
subject you can craft an ethereal tether with them. You perceive what 
they perceive and can discern realities about someone tethered to you 
or their surroundings no matter the distance. Someone willingly 
tethered to you can communicate with you over the tether as if you were 
in the room with them.

* [ ] Mystical Puppet Strings: When you **use magic to control a 
person’s actions** they have no memory of what you had them do and bear 
you no ill will.

* [ ] Spell Augmentation: When you **deal damage to a creature** you 
can shunt a spell’s energy into them—end one of your ongoing spells and 
add the spell’s level to the damage dealt.

* [ ] Self-Powered: When you have time, arcane materials, and a safe 
space, you can create your own place of power. Describe to the GM what 
kind of power it is and how you’re binding it to this place, the GM 
will tell you one kind of creature that will have an interest in your 
workings.

# Wizard Spells

## Cantrips

You prepare all of your cantrips every time you prepare spells without 
having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.

* Light (Cantrip): An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as 
bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel, 
but it is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of 
the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your 
presence.

* Unseen Servant (Cantrip *Ongoing*): You conjure a simple invisible 
construct that can do nothing but carry items. It has load 3 and 
carries anything you hand to it. It cannot pick up items on its own and 
can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen servant 
appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant 
that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled, 
dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the unseen servant serves you 
until you end the spell.

* Prestidigitation (Cantrip): You perform minor tricks of true magic. 
If you touch an item as part of the casting you can make cosmetic 
changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm it, flavor it, or 
change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an item you 
can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself. 
Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they won’t 
fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

## Level 1 Spells

* [ ] Contact Spirits (Level 1 *Summoning*): Name the spirit you wish 
to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull that creature through the 
planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to answer any 
one question you ask to the best of its ability.

* [ ] Detect Magic (Level 1 *Divination*): One of your senses is 
briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here is magical.

* [ ] Telepathy (Level 1 *Divination Ongoing*): You form a telepathic 
bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to converse with that 
person through your thoughts. You can only have one telepathic bond at 
a time.

* [ ] Charm Person (Level 1 *Enchantment Ongoing*) The person (not 
beast or monster) you touch while casting this spell counts you as a 
friend until they take damage or you prove otherwise.

* [ ] Invisibility Level 1 (*Illusion Ongoing*): Touch an ally: nobody 
can see them. They’re invisible! The spell persists until the target 
attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing you can’t 
cast a spell.

* [ ] Magic Missile (Level 1 *Evocation*): Projectiles of pure magic 
spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one target.

* [ ] Alarm (Level 1): Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until 
you prepare spells again your magic will alert you if a creature 
crosses that circle. Even if you are asleep, the spell will shake you 
from your slumber.

## Level 3 Spells

* [ ] Dispel Magic (Level 3): Choose a spell or magic effect in your 
presence: this spell rips it apart. Lesser spells are ended, powerful 
magic is just reduced or dampened so long as you are nearby.

* [ ] Visions Through Time (Level 3 *Divination*): Cast this spell and 
gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths of time. The GM 
will reveal the details of a grim portent to you—a bleak event that 
will come to pass without your intervention. They’ll tell you something 
useful about how you can interfere with the grim portent’s dark 
outcomes. Rare is the portent that claims “You’ll live happily ever 
after.” Sorry.

* [ ] Fireball (Level 3 *Evocation*): You evoke a mighty ball of flame 
that envelops your target and everyone nearby, inflicting 2d6 damage 
which ignores armor.

* [ ] Mimic (Level 3 *Ongoing*): You take the form of someone you touch 
while casting this spell. Your physical characteristics match theirs 
exactly but your behavior may not. This change persists until you take 
damage or choose to return to your own form. While this spell is 
ongoing you lose access to all your wizard moves.

* [ ] Mirror Image (Level 3 *Illusion*): You create an illusory image 
of yourself. When you are attacked, roll a d6. On a 4, 5, or 6 the 
attack hits the illusion instead, the image then dissipates and the 
spell ends.

* [ ] Sleep (Level 3 *Enchantment*): 1d4 enemies you can see of the 
GM’s choice fall asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are 
affected. They awake as normal: loud noises, jolts, pain.

## Level 5 Spells

* [ ] Cage (Level 5 *Evocation Ongoing*): The target is held in a cage 
of magical force. Nothing can get in or out of the cage. The cage 
remains until you cast another spell or dismiss it. While the spell is 
ongoing, the caged creature can hear your thoughts and you cannot leave 
sight of the cage.

* [ ] Contact Other Plane (Level 5 *Divination*): You send a request to 
another plane. Specify who or what you’d like to contact by location, 
type of creature, name, or title. You open a two-way communication with 
that creature. Your communication can be cut off at any time by you or 
the creature you contacted.

* [ ] Polymorph (Level 5 *Enchantment*): Your touch reshapes a creature 
entirely, they stay in the form you craft until you cast a spell. 
Describe the new shape you craft, including any stat changes, 
significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will then tell you 
one or more of these: 1) The form will be unstable and temporary. 2) 
The creature’s mind will be altered as well. 3) The form has an 
unintended benefit or weakness.

* [ ] Summon Monster (Level 5 *Summoning Ongoing*): A monster appears 
and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your character, but with 
access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier for all stats, 1 HP, 
and uses your damage dice. The GM will tell you the type of monster you 
get based on the traits you select. The creature remains on this plane 
until it dies or you dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing you take -1 
to cast a spell. The monster also gets your choice of 1d6 of these 
traits: 1) It has +2 instead of +1 to one stat. 2) It’s not reckless. 
3) It does 1d8 damage. 4) Its bond to your plane is strong: +2 HP for 
each level you have. 5) It has some useful adaptation.

## Level 7 Spells

* [ ] Dominate (Level 7 *Enchantment Ongoing*): Your touch pushes your 
mind into someone else’s. You gain 1d4 hold. If you run out of hold the 
spell ends. If the target takes damage you lose 1 hold. While the spell 
is ongoing you cannot cast a spell. Spend one hold to make the target 
take one of these actions: 1) Speak a few words of your choice. 2) Give 
you something they hold. 3) Make a concerted attack on a target of your 
choice. 4) Truthfully answer one question.

* [ ] True Seeing (Level 7 *Divination Ongoing*): You see all things as 
they truly are. This effect persists until you tell a lie or dismiss 
the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Shadow Walk (Level 7 *Illusion*) The shadows you target with this 
spell become a portal for you and your allies. Name a location, 
describing it with a number of words up to your level. Stepping through 
the portal deposits you and any allies present when you cast the spell 
at the location you described. The portal may only be used once by each 
ally.

* [ ] Contingency (Level 7 *Evocation*): Choose a 5th level or lower 
spell you know. Describe a trigger condition using a number of words 
equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until you choose to 
unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens first. 
You don’t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You 
may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast 
Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces 
the old one.

* [ ] Cloudkill (Level 7 *Summoning Ongoing*): A cloud of fog drifts 
into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of Death, filling the 
immediate area. Whenever a creature in the area takes damage it takes 
an additional, separate 1d6 damage which ignores armor. This spell 
persists so long as you can see the affected area, or until you dismiss 
it.

## Level 9 Spells

* [ ] Antipathy (Level 9 *Enchantment Ongoing*): Choose a target and 
describe a type of creature or an alignment. Creatures of the specified 
type or alignment cannot come within sight of the target. If a creature 
of the specified type does find itself within sight of the target, it 
immediately flees. This effect continues until you leave the target’s 
presence or you dismiss the spell. While the spell is ongoing you take 
-1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Alert (Level 9 *Divination*): Describe an event. The GM will tell 
you when that event occurs, no matter where you are or how far away the 
event is. If you choose, you can view the location of the event as 
though you were there in person. You can only have one Alert active at 
a time.

* [ ] Soul Gem (Level 9): You trap the soul of a dying creature within 
a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still 
be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves 
against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any 
time but it can never be recaptured once freed.

* [ ] Shelter (Level 9 *Evocation Ongoing*): You create a structure out 
of pure magical power. It can be as large as a castle or as small as a 
hut, but is impervious to all non-magical damage. The structure endures 
until you leave it or you end the spell.

* [ ] Perfect Summons (Level 9 *Summoning*): You teleport a creature to 
your presence. Name a creature or give a short description of a type of 
creature. If you named a creature, that creature appears before you. If 
you described a type of creature, a creature of that type appears 
before you.



# Equipment

The musty tombs and forgotten treasure troves of the world are filled 
with useful items. The fighter can find a sharp new sword or the thief 
might stumble across a deadly poison. Most items are mundane—not 
magical or intrinsically unique in any way. Any item that is magical or 
one-of-a-kind is not mundane for the purposes of moves. The fighter’s 
signature weapon is never mundane.

Each piece of equipment will have a number of tags. These will tell you 
something about how the equipment affects the character using it (like 
+Armor) or suggest something about the way it is used (like the Range 
tags). Like everything else in Dungeon World, these guide the fiction 
you’re creating in play. If a weapon is awkward, it might mean that 
you’re more likely to drop it when you fail that hack and slash roll.

By no means is this an exhaustive list—feel free to create your own 
tags.

## General Equipment Tags

These are general tags that can apply to just about any piece of gear. 
You’ll see them on armor, weapons or general adventuring tools.

* *Applied*: It’s only useful when carefully applied to a person or to 
something they eat or drink.
* *Awkward*: It’s unwieldy and tough to use.
* *+Bonus*: It modifies your effectiveness in a specified situation. It 
might be “+1 forward to spout lore” or “-1 ongoing to hack and slash.”
* *n coins*: How much it costs to buy, normally. If the cost includes 
* “-Charisma” a little negotiation subtracts the haggler’s Charisma 
score (not modifier) from the price.
* *Dangerous*: It’s easy to get in trouble with it. If you interact 
with it without proper precautions the GM may freely invoke the 
consequences of your foolish actions.
* *Ration*: It’s edible, more or less.
* *Requires*: It’s only useful to certain people. If you don’t meet the 
requirements it works poorly, if at all.
* *Slow*: It takes minutes or more to use.
* *Touch*: It’s used by touching it to the target’s skin.
* *Two-handed*: It takes two hands to use it effectively.
* *n weight*: Count the listed amount against your load. Something with 
no listed weight isn’t designed to be carried. 100 coins in standard 
denominations is 1 weight. The same value in gems or fine art may be 
lighter or heavier.
* *Worn*: To use it, you have to be wearing it.
* *n Uses*: It can only be used *n* times.

## Weapons

Weapons don’t kill monsters, people do. That’s why weapons in Dungeon 
World don’t have a listed damage. A weapon is useful primarily for its 
tags which describe what the weapon is useful for. A dagger is not 
useful because it does more or less damage than some other blade. It’s 
useful because it’s small and easy to strike with at close distance. A 
dagger in the hands of the wizard is not nearly so dangerous as one in 
the hands of a skilled fighter.

## Weapon Tags

Weapons may have tags that are primarily there to help you describe 
them (like Rusty or Glowing) but these tags have a specific, mechanical 
effect.

* *n Ammo*: It counts as ammunition for appropriate ranged weapons. The 
number indicated does not represent individual arrows or sling stones, 
but represents what you have left on hand.
* *Forceful*: It can knock someone back a pace, maybe even off their 
feet.
* *+n Damage*: It is particularly harmful to your enemies. When you 
deal damage, you add *n* to it.
* *Ignores Armor*: Don’t subtract armor from the damage taken.
* *Messy*: It does damage in a particularly destructive way, ripping 
people and things apart.
* *n Piercing*: It goes right through armor. When you deal damage with 
*n* piercing, you subtract *n* from the enemy’s armor for that attack.
* *Precise*: It rewards careful strikes. You use DEX to hack and slash 
with this weapon, not STR.
* *Reload*: After you attack with it, it takes more than a moment to 
reset for another attack.
* *Stun*: When you attack with it, it does stun damage instead of 
normal damage.
* *Thrown*: Throw it at someone to hurt them. If you volley with this 
weapon, you can’t choose to mark off ammo on a 7–9; once you throw it, 
it’s gone until you can recover it.

Weapons have tags to indicate the range at which they are useful. 
Dungeon World doesn’t inflict penalties or grant bonuses for “optimal 
range” or the like, but if your weapon says Hand and an enemy is ten 
yards away, a player would have a hard time justifying using that 
weapon against him.

* *Hand*: It’s useful for attacking something within your reach, no 
further.
* *Close*: It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach plus a 
foot or two.
* *Reach*: It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet 
away—maybe as far as ten.
* *Near*: It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their 
eyes.
* *Far*: It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.

## Weapon List

The stats below are for typical items. There are, of course, 
variations. A dull long sword might be -1 damage instead while a 
masterwork dagger could be +1 damage. Consider the following to be 
stats for typical weapons of their type—a specific weapon could have 
different tags to represent its features.

* Ragged Bow near, 15 coins, 2 weight
* Fine Bow near, far, 60 coins, 2 weight
* Hunter’s Bow near, far, 100 coins, 1 weight
* Crossbow near, +1 damage, reload, 35 coins, 3 weight
* Bundle of Arrows 3 ammo, 1 coin, 1 weight
* Elven Arrows 4 ammo, 20 coins, 1 weight
* Club, Shillelagh close, 1 coin, 2 weight
* Staff close, two-handed, 1 coin, 1 weight
* Dagger, Shiv, Knife hand, 2 coins, 1 weight
* Throwing Dagger thrown, near, 1 coin, 0 weight
* Short Sword, Axe, Warhammer, Mace close, 8 coins, 1 weight
* Spear reach, thrown, near, 5 coins, 1 weight
* Long Sword, Battle Axe, Flail close, +1 damage, 15 coins, 2 weight
* Halberd reach, +1 damage, two-handed, 9 coins, 2 weight
* Rapier close, precise, 25 coins, 1 weight
* Dueling Rapier close, 1 piercing, precise, 50 coins, 2 weight

## Armor

Armor is heavy, difficult to wear and is damned uncomfortable. Some 
classes are better trained to ignore these drawbacks, but anyone can 
strap on a suit of armor and enjoy the benefits it grants.

### Armor Tags

Armor, like weapons, has tags. Some are purely descriptive but the ones 
below have some mechanical effect on the player wearing them

* *n Armor*: It protects you from harm and absorbs damage. When you 
take damage, subtract your armor from the total. If you have more than 
one item with *n Armor*, only the highest value counts.
* *+n Armor*: It protects you and stacks with other armor. Add its 
value to your total armor.
* *Clumsy*: It’s tough to move around with. -1 ongoing while using it. 
This penalty is cumulative.

### Armor List

* Leather, Chainmail 1 armor, worn, 10 coins, 1 weight
* Scale Mail 2 armor, worn, clumsy, 50 coins, 3 weight
* Plate 3 armor, worn, clumsy, 350 coins, 4 weight
* Shield +1 armor, 15 coins, 2 weight

## Dungeon Gear

* Adventuring Gear (5 uses, 20 coins, 1 weight): Adventuring gear is a 
collection of useful mundane items such as chalk, poles, spikes, ropes, 
etc. When you rummage through your adventuring gear for some useful 
mundane item, you find what you need and mark off a use.

* Bandages (3 uses, slow, 5 coins, 0 weight): When you have a few 
minutes to bandage someone else’s wounds, heal them of 4 damage and 
expend a use.
* Poultices and Herbs (2 uses, slow, 10 coins, 1 weight): When you
