## Dice Basics

This game uses regular six-sided dice. The number before the“d6” is how
many dice to roll, and any number after a “+” is how much to add to the
roll. For instance, 2d6+2 means to roll two dice and then add two to
the total.

**The Exploding Die:** One die (and only one die)of every roll is an
“exploding” die (abbreviated as “Xd.”) Use a different color die to
represent this or roll the dice one at a time making the last die
rolled the exploding die. When the Xd results in a six, then roll again
adding the six and the new result together. If a six comes upon the
reroll, then you add six and reroll again! Keep doing it until the Xd
lands on something other than a 6.

**Splitting Dice:** Skill and attribute dice may be split into “steps.”
The steps follow a pattern 1d6, 1d6+1, 1d6+2, 2d6, 2d6+1, 2d6+2, 3d6,
etc. When creating a character, an attribute or skill die may be split
into 3 “pieces.” Those pieces could be distributed as three individual
“+1” steps, a +1 and a +2, or all three steps could be recombined back
into a whole d6.

**Combining Dice:** Sometimes you will need to know how to add dice
totals together. This is common when you add attribute dice to the
skill dice you distribute at character creation. First, add the whole
dice together. Then add the “+1s” and “+2s” together. Every total of 3
converts back into a whole d6 and any leftover plusses are added back
to the total. In the end, you should have either a whole number of
dice, a number of dice +1, or a number of dice +2. If you ended up with
a “plus” of +3 or more, continue to convert each +3 back into whole
dice.

For example:

* (1d6) + (1d6) = 2d6.
* (1d6+1) + (1d6) = 2d6+1
* (1d6+2) + (1d6) = 2d6+2
* (1d6+1) + (1d6+1) = 2d6+2
* (1d6+2) + (1d6+1) = 2d6 + 1d6 = 3d6
* (1d6+2) + (2d6+2) = 2d6 + 1d6 +1 = 3d6+1

## How to Make a Character

1. Distribute 11 dice between the four attributes. No attribute may
have less than one nor more than four dice assigned to it.
2. Distribute 7 dice to skills and perks. No skill may have more than
two dice assigned to it at character creation.
3. Select Complications.
4. Choose gear.

## Attributes

Each character has four attributes that measure basic physical and
mental abilities that are common to every creature. Characters
distribute 11d6 among the four attributes. These are normally rated on
a scale of 1d6 to 4d6, although perks may change these limits. When
putting dice into each attribute you can put whole dice in each or use
a mixture of whole dice and plusses.

**Might:** represents physical strength, and toughness. The amount of
damage dealt when striking unarmed is equal to a character’s Might.

**Agility:** represents aim and coordination.

**Wit:** represents mental creativity and intelligence.

**Charm:** represents charisma, resolve, and leadership.

## Skills

Characters are further defined by skills. Players may allocate 7d6 on
skills to best represent the unique talents of their character. Unspent
skill dice can be used to purchase Perks.

Skills are areas of expertise that represent focus and training. When
putting dice into each skill you can put whole dice in each or use a
mixture of whole dice and plusses. No more than 2d6 may be spent on
each skill during character creation. Each skill defaults to the level
of the related attribute. For example, a character who has a Might of
3d6 starts with 3d6 in all skills under Might before allocating any
dice. If two dice are added to Brawling it is recorded as 5d6, because
3d6 + 2d6 = 5d6.

The following is an incomplete skill list designed to serve as an
inspiration for what may be used in a game. Each game should have a
tailored list of appropriate skills which might include new skills or
modify examples given. For example, a typical sword and sorcery game
might use an expanded list of melee skills to further define its
warriors while a science fiction game may lump them all into a unified
skill named “Melee Combat.”

**All Genres**

* Might Skills: Brawling, Knife, Lift, Mace, Stamina
* Agility Skills: Athletics, Dodge, Pickpocket, Stealth, Throwing
* Wit Skills: History, Language, Medicine, Pick Locks, Search, Tracking
* Charm Skills: Command, Courage, Diplomacy, Persuasion, Seduce

**Fantasy**

* Might Skills: Axe, Pole Arm, Smithing, Sword
* Agility Skills: Bow, Crossbow
* Wit Skills: Magic
* Charm Skills: Ride

**Modern or Sci-fi**

* Agility Skills: BFG, Drive, Pilot, Pistol, Rifle
* Wit Skills: Computer, Navigation, Repair, Science
* Charm Skills: Streetwise

*Note: Combat skills are not allowed specializations.*

## Skill Specializations

Specializations are focused aspects of a skill. For example, Drive
specializations might include Car and Motorcycle. One skill die can be
spent to gain three specialty dice. Combat skills don't have
specializations. Example: A character with an Agility of 3d6 focuses on
the Running Speciality of Athletics. He spends one skill die in it, but
records it as Running 6d6 on his character sheet. He has an Athletics
of only 3d6. This is the only time the 2d6 skill limit can be exceeded
during character creation.

## Perks

During character creation, unspent skill dice may be spent to acquire
Perks. The following perks are meant to serve as examples and
inspiration. The cost listed next to each is in whole skill dice.

***Racial Perks***

* Dwarf (1): You’re long lived, you can see in the dark, you receive +2
to smithing or any one other craft skill. Your maximum Might is 5d6 but
your maximum Agility is 3d6.
* Elf (2): You’re long lived, you can see in the dark, you receive a +1
on all ranged attacks, Your maximum Agility is 5d6 but your maximum
Might is only 3d6.
* Reptoid (2): You’re green and scaly, this gives a +1 Armor Value.You
also have claw-tipped fingers which grant you +1 damage on unarmed
attacks.
* Robot (4): You don’t eat, breathe, or sleep. You can have your memory
wiped. You don’t heal but you can be repaired. As long as your memory
core survives you may be rebuilt if destroyed.

***General Perks***

* Attractive (1): Others find the character pleasing to look at. This
can help reduce suspicions or distract others depending on the given
situation. Once per session, the character can double one roll for any
action related to their appearance. Examples include seduction, a
subtle bluff or simply distracting guards.
* Daredevil (2): Once per session you may throw caution to the wind
taking extremely reckless action that may result in your own death.
Your dodge, block, and parry are reduced by half however your Soak
score is doubled when resisting damage for one round.
* Destiny (2): Characters with Destiny feel they are fated to some
grand purpose. Once per game session a character may declare a failed
roll is not part of their destiny and immediately reroll to get a
different result.
* Favors (1): People owe you. Once per session, you can call in one of
those debts. This can take the form of information, temporary use of
equipment (borrowing a truck, plow, pump action shotgun, etc.), a place
to hide someone or something for a brief time, or any similar event.
* Lucky (2): Once per session you can declare you are feeling lucky.
Double the result of your next roll.
* Perceptive (2): The GM may reveal small clues to you that others
would miss. Once per session, a character may announce they are
studying an object or situation and the GM may reveal something that
would be impossible for a normal character to determine. If nothing is
revealed this perk may be used again.
* Recall (1): Any time the character chooses to recall anything he has
experienced, the GM must tell him the truth in as much detail as the
character would have been aware.
* Sidekick (3): You have a boon companion willing to join in your
adventures. This character only gets 9d6 to spend on attributes and 4d6
to spend on starting skills. They normally only receive 1 to 3 XP per
session, but never as many as their fearless leader.

***Esoteric Perks***

* Energy Blast (5): You can throw bolts of pure energy. These do 4d6
damage and use your Throwing skill.
* ESP (3): You can read minds. Targets resist using their Charm against
your Wits.
* Flying (4): You can fly (at twice your move).
* Regeneration (3): You heal 1 wound level/hour.
* Sorcerer (3): You’re magically sensitive. Magic spells really work
for you.
* Telekinesis (3): You can move stuff with your mind. Make a Wits roll
and treat it like the Lift skill. People resist using their Might.
* X-Ray Vision (3): you can see through 1 foot of material.

## Complications

During character creation only, players may select up to two
complications. These grant no additional skill dice during character
creation; however, anytime one comes up in play the character earns one
XP. Characters may not earn more than one XP per complication per
session regardless of how often it comes up.

**Age:** You’re either really old or really young. In addition to all 
the social issues caused by your age, the GM might choose to impose a 
penalty to an action based on your character’s age. Grandpa throws a 
hip, a weird dude offers you candy on the street, and it's hard for 
either of you to seduce the supermodel at the bar. Whenever your age 
causes you great difficulty receive one XP.

**Crazy:** You have issues that are guaranteed to put the therapist’s 
kids through college. Could be you’re just really paranoid, or maybe 
just a touch too OCD. That fear of almost everything could also be a 
problem. Then again maybe you really are Napoleon and everyone else is 
wrong, good luck convincing anyone else since you're a lunatic. Earn 
one XP any time your psychosis really gets in the way.

**Enemies:** Someone doesn’t like you at all. And they are a credible 
threat. Maybe they have more friends than you, or maybe they’re just 
bigger and meaner. Either way, you have your own personal bully. You 
earn the bonus XP when they complicate your life.

**Gremlins:** You have a special touch. Specifically, the kind that 
breaks machines. You’re no good with engines, electronics, magical 
gizmos, or any other trinket. If it’s a device, you can’t trust it. 
Earn one XP whenever the GM takes his one free shot on you this way.

**Personal Code:** You live by a creed and you will not cross that 
line. Maybe you won’t fight an unarmed opponent and always make sure 
they know it's coming or maybe you never tell a lie. No matter how you 
define it, your code has to mean something. Some caped crusaders won’t 
kill, paladins won’t resort to deception, and sometimes there is even 
honor among thieves. Earn one XP whenever your code complicates your or 
your friends’ success.

**Skeletons in the Closet:** You earn the bonus XP whenever your past 
comes back to haunt you.

**Unlucky in Love:** Things just don’t work out for some folks. You earn
bonus XP when your love life falls apart in a meaningful way.

**Unlucky in Money:** You have a hard time holding onto money. You earn
the bonus XP when you lose a significant amount of cash through your
own foolishness or bad luck and have nothing to show for it.

## Gear

Some games may assume the character has the trappings of a middle-class
lifestyle, while others may take place in a world of fantasy where only
those items in your pack mean the difference between life and death.

Characters might start with one piece of related gear for each skill
they allocated dice to during character creation. For example a pistol
for the Pistols skill, a medic bag for Medicine, etc. For anything
else, beg the GM.

# The Game Mechanics

## Scenes and Rounds

A scene is a single encounter, an ongoing challenge, or what would
narratively be described of as a single scene in a film or TV show.
Sometimes, the gamemaster may gloss over even the day-to-day activity
of a group of characters to arrive at the next scene. For example, when
traveling a long distance on foot, the GM might play out a scene in the
starting village, then advance to the next scene near the destination
or a point of interest, days later.

When scenes become action-oriented, and it is important to know who
acts before someone else, the game switches over to timekeeping by
rounds. When the matter at hand is settled or the story reaches the
point where time is no longer tracked by rounds, the scene usually ends
as well.

## General (non-combat) Challenges

Characters roll the appropriate skill against a set target number based
on the task attempted. (Remember that every skill already includes its
corresponding attribute dice within its dice.) Tasks may have a
specific Target Number (TN) listed, or may use a plain language
descriptor (simple, moderate, etc.) that corresponds to the following
chart. Both may also be listed. For example, the GM or a rule might
instruct you to make a Moderate (TN15) roll.

* 5: Very Simple
* 10: Simple
* 15: Moderate
* 20: Hard
* 25: Very Hard
* 30+ Legendary

**Very Simple:** Nearly everyone can do it. These checks should only be
made if a success is critical to the scenario at hand and the character
would roll 3d6 or less, otherwise the GM should presume that success is
automatic.

**Simple:** Characters will seldom have trouble with these tasks, but
an untrained individual may find them challenging. Characters rolling
6d6 or more may opt to skip this roll and assume they presume they
scored a 10.

**Moderate:** Average character have a reasonable chance of failing at
this level. Consistent success often requires training in the skill or
a high level of natural ability.

**Hard:** Tasks at this level are truly challenging. To succeed a
character needs to be well skilled or very lucky.

**Very Hard:** Challenges of this level fall into the domain of masters
in the skill being used; few others will succeed at them.

**Heroic:** These challenges are almost impossible. Only the very lucky
or true masters can consistently succeed at them.

## Order of Actions in a Round

*(A round is considered to be approximately 10 seconds)*

1. Declare all actions planned for the round.
2. Determine the order of Initiative by rolling Agility for each
character. The highest result goes first.
3. Characters make rolls for all actions they are attempting. The
target may get an opportunity to resist or avoid the action.

## Multiple Actions

Characters may attempt to do more than one thing on a turn by
withholding one die from every action they attempt for each action
beyond the first. For instance, if a character tries to shoot twice, he
will subtract one die from each attempt. Characters may not attempt an
action if this “multiple action penalty” reduces them to zero dice in
that action.

Note that every character may move 5 paces for free in a round. Moving
10 paces counts as an action, thus doing so inflicts a -1d6 penalty on
every other action performed that round. Alternatively, the character
may use a skill (usually athletics in most settings) to move faster,
but that would also count as an action.

## Scale Factor

Not all objects are on the same scale. Humans and horses may be close
enough to be equals, but humans and dragons aren’t. When things that
are different scales engage in combat, compare their scale factor.

***Scale: Scale Factor***

* Character Scale: Characters, Most Animals: 0
* Large Scale: Car, Wagon, Small boat: 5
* Huge Scale: Dragon, Mecha, Tank: 10
* Giant Scale: Fighter, Light Transport, Heavy Mecha: 15
* Colossal Scale: Capital Ship, Space Station: 20

The difference in scale factors is the scale modifier. When the bigger
thing attacks the smaller thing, this modifier is a bonus to the damage
roll. When the smaller thing attacks the larger thing, this is a bonus
to the large thing’s soak score.

When a big thing attacks a smaller thing, that smaller thing receives
the scale modifier as a bonus to an active defense (usually dodge, but
it could be block or parry if that makes sense.)

When a smaller thing attacks a big thing, that small thing receives the
scale modifier as a bonus to the attack roll.

Note that weapons may be designed to work at different scales. For
example, a capital ship might have point defense guns at the giant
scale, to attack enemy fighters. These guns could easily target another
capital ship (they would receive the scale modifier as a bonus to hit)
but the target capital ship would receive the same modifier as a bonus
to soak the damage.

Scale is somewhat arbitrary and has no concrete definitions. A big
thing that is weak may be treated as if it is a different scale than
size alone might suggest, and might be treated as different sizes for
different purposes. For example, a primitive hot air balloon of the
18th century might be considered to be huge when others attack it, for
the purpose of the attack roll, but behaves as if it is only character
scale to resist damage. This would make it easy to hit, yet it would
have no special resistance to character-scale damage.

Finally, when applying these scale Factor modifiers, don’t convert them
to dice. Just add or subtract these numbers, as needed, from the dice
totals. This means that “+5” means just that, add five.

## Movement

Units of distance in Mini Six are measured in “paces.” A pace may
alternatively be called a yard or a meter, based on GM fiat. If you use
a grid to track characters, then each square or hex is one
pace/yard/meter.

A character may move up to 5 paces as a free action or move 10 paces at
the cost of one action. If a character wishes to run faster, make an
athletics roll (or whatever appropriate skill is available in the game
or setting) with a TN of 10.

## Experience

At the end of each session the GM awards each character a number of
experience points. The number of points given per session typically
varies from 3 to 7 depending on drama, danger, success, and fun!

**Spending experience points (XP)**

Any skill may be increased one plus (from 2d6 to 2d6+1, for example) by
spending a number of XPs equal to its current number of dice. No skill
may be increased more than one plus per session. Skill specializations
cost only half as much to raise, rounding up.

Experience points are also used to improve attributes. This costs 10
times the number of dice a character has in the attribute to raise it
one plus. All skills under this attribute also improve by one plus. For
example, if a character had a Wit of 3d6+1 and wanted to improve it to
3d6+2 it would cost 30 XP.

## Hero Points

Characters start with 1 hero point every adventure and may spend it
before any roll. Hero Points provide a variety of options, but once
spent the point is lost forever.

* Gain a +6 to any single roll (up to 3 points may be used at one time
when using this effect).
* Just a flesh wound. Once per combat, a hero point can be used to
reduce the severity of a character’s wounds by one level.
* Make a small change to their location (locating an unlocked window,
finding a can of WD40 and a roll of duct tape, etc.)
* “Buy a clue.” Sometimes players are at a loss or think they might
have missed something. This gives them the option to find that detail
that they would have otherwise missed.

Hero Points are earned through superior play and given as an incentive
by the GM to help encourage the style of action desired in a game. If
playing a gritty western and the character makes a clever quip using
the “in-game” jargon that makes everyone laugh without disrupting play,
that may be worth a Hero Point. Unless completely against the nature of
the game played, extremely clever ideas and grand heroic deeds should
always be rewarded. Lesser actions may also be rewarded at GM fiat.

## Healing

Natural Healing: If a wounded character rests they are allowed a Might
check and if successful they heal a wound level. The frequency of the
check depends on the severity of the character’s wounds.

Assisted Healing: Characters with the Medicine skill can attempt to
help others heal more quickly. A skill check may be made once per day
for each patient treated. On a successful roll, the patient heals one
wound level.

*Wound Level: Frequency (N. Healing): Might Difficulty: Assisted
Healing Difficulty*

* Stunned: 1 minute: automatic: Simple (5)
* Wounded: 4 hours: 6: Moderate (15)
* Severely Wounded: 2 days: 6: Moderate (15)
* Incapacitated: 1 week: 8: Hard (20)
* Mortally Wounded: 2 weeks: 9: Very Hard (25)

# Combat

## Attacking a Target

The Target Number, or TN, is the number needed to successfully hit the
target. The base target number of an attack is based on the target’s
Defense score.

**Range:** Add the range modifier to the Target Number in all cases 
(Point Blank / Hand-to-Hand -5, Short +0, Medium +5, Long +10). See the 
sample gear list for ranges.

**Cover:** If the target is behind at least 50% cover, add +5 to the 
Target Number. Add +10 for 75% cover. It’s impossible to hit a target 
behind 100% cover. Darkness can also be considered as cover at the GM’s 
whim.

## Defenses

Characters calculate their Dodge, Block, and Parry prior to the game. 
This static number becomes the attacker’s TN modified as noted above. 
To calculate each, multiply the number of dice a character has in the 
relevant skill by 3 and add any plusses to the total. Then note it down 
on the character sheet. For example, Sir Baelen has a Sword skill of 
5D+1. His static Parry score would become 16 ((5 x 3)+1) when armed 
with a sword.

* Block = (Brawling skill dice x 3) + plusses.
* Dodge = (Dodge skill dice x 3) + plusses.
* Parry = (Weapon skill dice x 3) + plusses.
* Soak = (Might attribute dice x 3) + plusses + armor value + any
magical, super-tech, or other armor bonus. (These bonuses will depend
on the setting or game. None are detailed in Bare Knuckle Edition.)

Full Dodge: If the character does nothing except dodge until his next 
turn they will add 10 to their Dodge score, and apply range and cover 
as usual. This result is useful against any number of attacks.

## Resisting Damage

When a target has been hit, the attacker rolls damage and the target’s
Soak score is subtracted from the damage. The player or GM then checks
the Wound Level chart below to see how badly the target was wounded.

**Wound Level: Damage Total Exceeds Total Soak Score By**

* Unharmed: 0 or less
* Stunned: 1 - 4
* Wounded: 5 - 9
* Severely Wounded (x): 5 - 9
* Incapacitated: 10 - 14
* Mortally Wounded: 15 - 19
* Dead: 20 or more

Note: Any additional damage level other than Unharmed that is lower
than or equal to the character’s current wound level moves the
character by one level toward death.

(x) Note: A character is Severely Wounded only if the result is
between 5 and 9 and they are currently at the Wounded level.

**Wound Level Effects**

* Stunned: -1D for all remaining actions this round and the next round.
* Wounded: -1D to all actions until healed.
* Severely Wounded: -2D on all actions until healed.
* Incapacitated: As a free action before losing consciousness, the
character may try to stay up with a Moderate (15) Stamina roll. If
successful, he may continue to act, but with a -3D penalty. If he
fails, he is knocked out for 5d6 minutes.
* Mortally Wounded: The character is near death and knocked unconscious
with no chance to stay up. Roll the character’s Might each round. The
character dies if the roll is less than the number of minutes he’s been
at this level.
* Dead: The character has perished.

# Vehicles

All vehicles from ancient chariots to futuristic starships are defined
by a common set of statistics. The following stats help the GM and
players quickly resolve all actions related to vehicles.

* Skill: The skill used to drive or pilot the craft.
* Scale: The size of the vehicle.
* Body: Used to resist damage.
* Maneuverability (MNV): How easy it is to handle. This gives a bonus
on drive and pilot skill rolls.
* Move: How fast it can travel.
* Crew: The number needed to successfully operate the vehicle.
* Passengers (Psg): Non-crew capacity.
* Weapons: Any armaments mounted on the vehicle.
* Cargo: How much stuff it can carry.

## Vehicle Combat

Some vehicles have weapons. Unless specified in their descriptions they
are considered to be the same scale as the vehicle. Attacks are
resolved in the same manner as character vs.character combat with the
only difference being the character uses their drive/pilot skill in
place to calculate the defense (Dodge) to avoid being hit. If the hit
was successful the character would roll the vehicle’s Body to resist
the damage and consult the following chart to determine how severe the
damage is:

**Damage Rolled: Effect**

* >= Body Roll: Overloaded System: Temporary effect for one round
* >= 2 X Body Roll: Damaged System: Permanent effect until repaired
* >= 3 X Body Roll: Destroyed System: Permanent effect until parts
replaced

Once the severity of the damage is determined the GM may roll randomly
on the the following chart or use common sense to determine which part
is damaged.

**Roll 1d6: Effect**

* 1: Lose 1D from Maneuverability
* 2 - 3: Random System Damaged
* 4 - 6: Structural Damage

**Effects of Damage**

* Maneuverability: Each time this is affected the vehicle loses 1d6.
This can go negative becoming a penalty to the driver’s skill roll.
* System Damaged: Randomly select a vehicle’s system and it either
becomes broken or loses 1d6 from its rating (if applicable). Examples
include communications/radio, sensors, shielding, sail, rigging, armor,
etc.
* Structural Damage: The vehicle receives one wound level. Treat these
like character wound levels. Mortally wounded vehicles stop functioning
and “dead” vehicles are considered destroyed.

## Ramming

When vehicles are at short range, a pursuer may try to ram.To
successfully ram the pilot needs to roll higher than the target’s Pilot
(or appropriate) skill check. If successful both vehicles take damage
equal to the body of attacking plus relative move dice.

## Multiple Weapons on Vehicles

When vehicles have more than one weapon of a single type,they can be
fired as a single salvo. This requires a successful Command skill roll
with the difficulty based on the number of guns being combined. Each
doubling of the number of weapons combined increases the damage by 1
plus (3d6, 3d6+1, 3d6+2, 4d6, etc.)

## Chases

When attempting to overtake or outrun an opponent the GM determines
what range you are at (Short/Medium/Long). Each turn each vehicle makes
a drive/pilot check, with the vehicle's Move dice granting a bonus. The
higher roll either closes or increases the distance 1 range as desired.
If reduced below Short you catch up, if increased beyond long you
escape.

## Repairing Vehicles

Characters may repair vehicles using their skills. The difficulty and
cost is determined on the following chart. The cost is based on the
price of a new vehicle.

**Dice Lost: Difficulty: Cost: Time Needed**

* 1d6: Easy: 10%: 1 Hour
* 2d6: Moderate: 15%: 4 Hours
* 3d6 or more: Difficult: 20%: 1 Day

## Vehicle Movement

Move dice represent relative speed between vehicles of similar types.
Vehicles are divided into four broad categories including Primitive
Craft /Muscle Powered, Motorized Ground and WaterCraft , Aircraft , and
Spacecraft . If vehicles of different categories must compare speeds,
such as a fighter chasing a tank, the faster vehicle is granted bonus
move dice based on the difference in speed factors in the following
chart:

**Speed Factor: Modifier**

* Primitive Craft or Muscle Powered: 0d6
* Motorized Ground or Water Craft: 2d6
* Aircraft: 5d6
* Spacecraft: 10d6

## Weapon Ranges in Space

Space is big and empty. Guns shoot great distances and shipsare
extremely fast. The ranges given are abstract units that are defined by
the needs of the individual game.

## Vehicle Costs

* $ Trivial cost.
* $$ Affordable to most.
* $$$ Affordable to the very wealthy, governments, and corps.
* $$$$ Only the richest individuals, most governments.

# Sample Characters by Genre

The characters presented below are sometimes less powerful than
starting player characters, sometimes more. Here is an arbitrary scale
to help determine potency:

* Threat: 1 Not a threat usually.
* Threat: 2 Minor threat only in a group.
* Threat: 3 Credible threat.
* Threat: 4 Watch out, Heroes!
* Threat: 5 Bold or foolish to even try.

Skills listed in each entry include the base attribute, but effects of
character scale haven’t been prefigured. All attributes,skills, and
gear are just for typical or average characters. Superior and inferior
individuals exist of every type.

Static defenses are precalculated with any skills listed. Soak is
listed as X(Y) where X is the base soak value and Y includes any armor
or other bonus listed. If a bonus die is granted to Brawling,Dodge, or
melee skills simply add 3 per die to the score.

While listed by genre type, these are only rough guidelines.If you need
a bloodthirsty alien race for a space opera campaign,take the orc
template, change its name to Xargon, arm them with laser rifles and a
4D skill with them. Likewise, if you need a few brooding emo vampires,
take the vampire template as written, give him hair product, eye
make-up, a trendy wardrobe, a tattoo, an attitude, and go team Edgar.

Animals have Wit scores of 0D due to their limited intelligence. Even
very clever animals have this restriction.

# Freeform Magic

The casting of magic spells is part of some settings. This optional
system can be used as a guideline for handling spellcasting. It is a
flexible, contemporaneous system, though the GM and players should
discuss the limitations of magic within the setting at hand. The GM
should consider whether certain applications of magic should be banned
or “gatekept” behind special perks.

In many settings, the use of spells will require that the caster has a
perk, such as Sorcerer. In addition, the caster will need a particular
skill, for example, “Spells” might be a Wit or a Charm skill depending
on whether magic is dependent on knowing complex lore for the former,
or depends on the caster’s force of will in the latter.

These rules will presume that the GM has designed a setting where
“Spellcasting” is a Wit skill, but it should be trivial to adjust this
to the particular of your game.

In this case, Spellcasting only works for characters who have the
Sorcerer perk. It’s possible that in very-high magic settings, the GM
might decide that a perk isn’t necessary to use magic, even if it
remains true that not everyone can cast magic. This would mean that all
player characters could use magic, and beyond that, only the NPCs that
the GM grants that power.

**The Limitations of Magic in a Setting**

* Can magic bring someone back from the dead?
* Can magic be used to change the past or travel through time?
* Can magic perform permanent transformations?
* Does magic require some special material component to work?
* Is spellcasting obvious?
* Is magic always obvious?
* Do some spells or types of magic require special training beyond
basic sorcery?
* Most settings that include magic will have at least some limitations
on magic.

## Balancing Sorcery Against Mundane Ability.

When designing a setting, this will be a major concern the GM should
consider if the game mixes mundane and magical characters. The
guidelines in Bare Knuckle Edition don’t necessarily create a system
where mundane characters will be the equals of characters designed to
cast spells. Think about what limits sorcery from dominating the
setting. Rarity is a common factor in fiction, but since players
generally play exceptional heroes, that factor alone may not do much to
balance the scales.

In some settings, this may not be a concern. For example, in one where
the heroes are students at a magical academy, every PC is presumed to
have access to magic, so little consideration to balance mundane PCs
against sorcerer PCs needs to be given. In others, magic might be rare,
even among heroes.

The following are some possible options to consider:

**Schools of Sorcery**

This option splits general sorcery into multiple skills so that it’s
much more costly to master every kind of magic. Examples could include
“White Magic” and “Dark Magic.” Alternatively, magic could be divided
into “abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation,
illusion, necromancy, and transmutation.” It could be split into “air,
earth, fire, and water.” Another permutation could be “altering magic,
controlling magic, and sensing magic.”

The division of magic will probably be related to something within the
setting, and some methods of division will create implicit limitations
about spellcasting. For example, in a setting where sorcery is divided
into the four classical Greek elements, magic that beguiles the mind
has no obvious placement. In this setting, it’s probable that all magic
spells have obvious physical effects related to their element, and that
magic that doesn’t relate in theme to those elements isn’t possible.

In a setting that chooses the Schools of Sorcery option, it must also
be decided whether characters can gain skill in multiple types.

**Magic as an Attribute**

In this option, Sorcery isn’t a skill, it’s a fifth attribute. A
character who chooses the Sorcery perk at character creation
distributes their attribute dice between Might, Agility, Wit, Charm,
and Magic, but doesn’t receive any additional attribute dice. The
character must distribute at least 1d6 to each attribute. Spellcasting
still exists as a skill under Magic.

**Backlash (suboption under Magic as an Attribute.)**

A further option would be that if the caster uses a number of skill
dice that exceeds the number of attribute dice when casting a spell,
failure brings additional danger. When the caster fails to successfully
cast the spell, then they must resist damage as if an enemy had
successfully hit them with a damaging effect equal to the difference.
They may resist damage with either Might or Magic, whichever is higher.

For example, the character has a Magic attribute of 3d6 and a Sorcery
skill of 8d6. When they cast a spell, they can choose how many dice to
roll, up to 8d6. (Remember, the 3d6 from the attribute is already
included within the 8d6 skill.)

Suppose that the caster tried a spell with TN of 26, and they decided
that they would need all 8d6 to succeed. They rolled poorly and got a
total of 24. They failed. Now they must suffer backlash of 5d6 damage!

## Casting a Freeform Spell

The caster must first describe the intended effect of the spell. Spells
should have a clear purpose and defined effect, and that effect should
thematically make sense. For example, a caster might want to cast a
“fire lash” at a target. The caster describes it as a whip made of
flame, that erupts toward the target. That sounds like a damaging
spell. There’s no reason for the spell to coincidentally have unrelated
characteristics, like the ability to breathe water or to also heal a
friend. Spells must remain along the theme defined in their
descriptions.

The caster is not obligated to make the impromptu spell any more
powerful than exactly what they need. For example, if last round they
cast their fire lash spell at a target far away and needed a long range
in order to reach the target, they can select a shorter range the next
time they cast in order to attack a nearer target. Every spell may be
independently calculated to take advantage of lesser needs.

Compare the base target number required for each component of the
spell. Range, Duration, The highest TN is the base target number. For
example, suppose that the character wants to cast a spell that will
transform him into an ogre. In this setting, an ogre is a being one
size bigger than a human.

When selecting the range, the choice is obvious. Since the caster is
casting the spell on themselves, they choose “self” (TN5.)

When selecting duration, the caster has a choice. Since they need to
keep the spell going, it must be sustainable or have a long automatic
duration. Moderate (TN 15) would allow them to sustain the spell at the
cost of incurring a multi-action penalty as long as they keep the spell
sustained. Hard (TN20) will mean the spell persists without the need to
be maintained for an hour or the remainder of the scene. Since the
caster expects things to go poorly after the transformation, they
choose the latter, Hard (TN 20) so that they don’t have to deal with
the penalty when they are an ogre.

Choosing the target is easy. They are casting the spell on themself, so
Very Simple (TN 5) is good enough.

Lastly, comes selecting the effect. This one is the most up to
interpretation. The spell doesn’t cause damage or heal directly, so the
caster ignores those charts. Looking at the non-damaging effects, they
see that the description of Hard (TN 20) fits the bill exactly.

The TNs of the spell are 5, 20, 5, and 20. Since 20 is the highest
number, that is the TN for the spell.

**Optional Rule: Advanced calculation.**

When calculating the TN of the spell, calculate base TN as normal. Look
at the numbers remaining for the other 3 spell factors and add to or
subtract from that TN as the chart below.

Max TN: Other TNs (Modifier)

* 5: 5 (0)
* 10: 5 (0), 10 (+1)
* 15: 5 (-1), 10 (0), 15 (+1)
* 20: 5 (-2), 10 (-1), 15 (0), 20 (+1)
* 25: 5 (-3), 10 (-2), 15 (-1), 20 (0), 25 (+1)
* 30: 5 (-4), 10 (-3), 15 (-2), 20 (-1), 25 (0), 30 (+1)

This chart adds +1 to the TN for each category that is the same level
as the base TN, and takes 1 away for every level below that number. 0,
or no modifier for the next level less difficult, -1 for the next, etc.
The exception to this rule is that when a spell has a TN of 5 in every
category, don’t calculate modifiers at all, the final TN will remain 5.

Looking at the ogre transformation spell example above, under this
calculation, the base TN and associated TNs remain the same. The Base
is TN 20 (the highest number.) There is another TN 20. The modifier for
any TN equal to the base TN is +1, which is also shown on the chart.
Next we have a Very Simple TN  5, which is three TN categories lower
than Hard TN 20, or -2 according to the chart. (Remember that we count
down three steps: “zero, minus one, minus two.”) We finally have
another TN 5, which is another -2 modifier.

Base TN 20 +1 -2 -2 = 17. The final spell TN is 17.

This optional rule rewards careful selection of spell characteristics,
but it takes more time, and the player might need the aid of a chart.

**Range**

* Very Simple (TN 5) Self/point blank/touch
* Simple (TN 10) (5/10/30)
* Moderate (TN 15) (10/30/100)
* Hard (TN 20) Everything within line of sight counts as short range.
* Very Hard (TN 25)  Any distance, beyond where the caster can see.

**Duration**

* Very Simple (TN 5) Instantaneous
* Simple (TN 10) Up to 1 round. The spell lasts until the caster’s next
turn. It may not be sustained.
* Moderate (TN 15) The spell persists as long as it is sustained (see
below.)
* Hard (TN 20) The spell persists for the remainder of the scene or up
to 1 hour.
* Very Hard (TN 25) The spell persists for up to one day.
* Legendary (TN 30) The spell is permanent.

**Target**

* Very Simple (TN 5) The spell only targets the caster.
* Simple (TN 10) The spell targets one being other than the caster or
an object.
* Moderate (TN 15) The spell targets everything in a small area of up
to 5 paces across.
* Hard (TN 20) The spell targets everything in an area up to 15 paces
across.
* Very Hard (TN 25) The spell targets everything in an area up to 30
paces across.

**Non-Damage Effects**

Non-damaging effects are the most difficult to adjudicate and require
the most give and take between the player and the gamemaster.

* Very Simple (TN 5) The spell can produce obviously magical effects
that can’t change or alter any target, or very minor abilities.
* Simple (TN10) Minor abilities. Breathe water. See in the dark. Clumsy
telekinesis.
* Moderate (TN 15) Spells that control the mind or perception of
another that may be sustained. Spells that enhance the target’s armor
or combat ability.
* Hard (TN 20) Spells that grant greater abilities. Flight.
Transformation into a tough creature no more than one scale factor
larger or smaller than the caster. Spells that control the mind or
perception of one or more targets that last an entire scene.
* Very Hard (TN 25) Spells that only the most skilled sorcerers can do.
Minor abilities may be made permanent, but the sorcerer still must
sustain the spell, so incurs a multi-action penalty until the caster
allows the spell to lapse.
* Legendary (TN 30) Resurrecting the dead. Time travel. Wish. Spells at
this level may be made permanent without the caster sustaining them.

**Damaging Effects**

* Simple (TN 10) Normal damage potential. As the casters attribute.
(Wit if spellcasting is a Wit skill, Charm otherwise.)
* Moderate (TN 15) Great damage potential. As the caster’s casting
skill.

Damaging spells may be sustained, but this counts as one action every
round as long as it’s sustained. Every round the damage is sustained,
the caster must make another casting check at a TN 5 higher than the
previous round. (This casting check is not a separate action. It is
part of the action necessary to sustain the spell.)

**Healing Effects**

* Very Simple (TN 5) Waking a sleeping character or returning an
unconscious character to consciousness without healing them.
* Simple (TN 10) Allowing the target a single check as natural healing.
* Moderate (TN 15) Healing one wound level, automatically (the target
doesn’t need to make a healing check)
* Hard (TN 20) Healing two wound levels automatically (the target
doesn’t need to make a healing check.)
* Very Hard (TN 25) Healing 3 wound levels at once.

Gamemasters may want to limit the amount of magical healing a character
can receive. A suggestion is that a character may only receive magical
healing once per day (between scenes) and once per scene otherwise.

**Rote Spells (Optional rule.)**

Under this rule, characters can learn specific spells. Unlike the
flexible casting rules above, the formula for the spell never changes.
Characters learn two rote spells for every whole die in their casting
skill. They may learn additional spells at a cost of 3 character points
apiece.

These rote spells are easier to cast. It is recommended to use the
optional advanced calculation rules to come up with the TN, then
subtract 3 from that. As always, the GM should keep an eye out for
spells that would break the game if abused. One way to help balance
that can be to require the spell to be highly defined. For example our
“ogre transformation spell” used an example above is exactly that - a
spell that transforms the caster into an ogre. It doesn’t transform the
caster into anything else other than an ogre, even if of similar size,
because that’s how the player defined it. There’s no reason that the GM
must be that specific, but if the spell seems to be near the edge of
what’s going to break the game, (and there’s no reason an ogre
transformation spell would in a high fantasy setting), being nit-picky
and specific is a way to hem a spell in a bit.

Using our ogre transformations spell from the advanced calculation

## 100 Level-less Spells

If you prefer spells that are level-less and scale up as the caster
becomes more powerful, use the list below. In the following spells, “L”
is a number equal to the caster’s level, an item is an object able to
be lifted with one hand, and an object is anything up to human size.
Unless otherwise noted, all spells with ongoing effects last up to L×10
minutes, and have a range of up to 40 feet. If a spell directly affects
another creature, the creature may make a save to avoid it (as
described previously). Success reduces or negates the spell’s effects.
