# Moves

# Basic Moves

## Hack and Slash

When you **attack an enemy in melee**, roll+Str. ***On a 10+*** you
deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option,
you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s
attack. ***On a 7–9***, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy
makes an attack against you.

## Volley

When you **take aim and shoot at an enemy at range**, roll+Dex. On a
10+ you have a clear shot—deal your damage. ***On a 7–9***, choose one
(whichever you choose you deal your damage):

* You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s
choice.
* You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage.
* You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.

## Defy Danger

When you **act despite an imminent threat** or **suffer a calamity**,
say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it:

* by powering through, +Str
* by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
* by enduring, +Con
* with quick thinking, +Int
* through mental fortitude, +Wis
* using charm and social grace, +Cha

***On a 10+***, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to
bear. ***On a 7–9***, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will
offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

## Defend

When you **stand in defense of a person, item, or location** under
attack, roll+Con. ***On a 10+***, hold 3. ***On a 7–9***, hold 1. So
long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is
attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:

* Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself.
* Halve the attack’s effect or damage.
* Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against
the attacker.
* Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level.

## Spout Lore

When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about something**,
roll+Int. ***On a 10+*** the GM will tell you something interesting and
useful about the subject relevant to your situation. ***On a 7–9*** the
GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it
useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the
truth, now.

## Discern Realities

When you **closely study a situation or person**, roll+Wis. ***On a
10+*** ask the GM three questions from the list below. ***On a 7–9***
ask one. Take +1 forward when acting on the answers.

* What happened here recently?
* What is about to happen?
* What should I be on the lookout for?
* What here is useful or valuable to me?
* Who’s really in control here?
* What here is not what it appears to be?

## Parley

When you **you have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them**,
roll+Cha. Leverage is something they need or want. ***On a 10+*** they
ask you for something and do it if you make them a promise first. ***On
a 7–9***, they need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.

## Aid or Interfere

When you **help or hinder someone you have a bond with**, roll+Bond
with them. ***On a 10+*** they take +1 or -2, your choice. ***On a
7–9*** you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.

# Special Moves

## Last Breath

When **you’re dying** you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black
Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just
roll, +nothing -- yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are).
***On a 10+*** you’ve cheated death—you’re in a bad spot but you’re
still alive. ***On a 7–9*** Death will offer you a bargain. Take it and
stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate
awaits you. On a miss, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s
own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.

## Encumbrance

When you **make a move while carrying weight** up to or equal to load,
you’re fine. When you make a move while carrying weight equal to load+1
or load+2, you take -1. When you make a move while carrying weight
greater than load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll
at -1, or automatically fail.

## Make Camp

When you **settle in to rest** consume a ration. If you’re somewhere
dangerous decide the watch order as well. If you have enough XP you may
Level Up. When you wake from at least a few uninterrupted hours of
sleep heal damage equal to half your max HP.

## Take Watch

When you **you’re on watch and something approaches the camp**
roll+Wis. ***On a 10+*** you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a
response, the camp takes +1 forward. ***On a 7–9*** you react just a
moment too late; the camp is awake but hasn’t had time to prepare. You
have weapons and armor but little else. On a miss whatever lurks
outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.

## Undertake a Perilous Journey

When you travel through hostile territory, choose one member of the
party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be
quartermaster (the same character cannot have two jobs). If you don’t
have enough party members or choose not to assign a job, treat that job
as if it had rolled a 6. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis.
***On a 10+*** the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required
by one. ***On a 10+*** the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it
takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much). On a 10+
the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on
it. ***On a 7–9*** each roles performs their job as expected: the
normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long
as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on
them either.

## Level Up

When you **have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater
than) your current level + 7**, subtract your current level +7 from
your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new advanced move from
your class. If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to
your spellbook.

Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your
modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and
current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.

## End of Session

When you **reach the end of a session**, choose one your bonds that you
feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or
otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if
they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you
wish.

Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled
that alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these
three questions as a group:

* Did we learn something new and important about the world?
* Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
* Did we loot a memorable treasure?

For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.

## Carouse

When you **return triumphant and throw a big party**, spend 100 coin
and roll + extra 100s of coin spent. ***On a 10+*** choose 3. ***On a
7–9*** choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really
out of hand.

* You befriend a useful NPC
* You hear rumors of an opportunity
* You gain useful information
* You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked

## Supply

When you **go to buy something with gold on hand**, if it’s something
readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at market
price. If it’s something special, beyond what’s usually available here,
or non-mundane, roll+Cha. ***On a 10+*** you find what you’re looking
for at a fair price. ***On a 7–9*** you’ll have to pay more or settle
for something similar.

## Recover

When you **do nothing but rest in comfort and safety** after a day of
rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one
debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical
or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.

## Recruit

When you **put out word that you’re looking to hire help**, roll. If
you make it known

* that your pay is generous, take +1
* what you’re setting out to do, take +1
* that they’ll get a share of whatever you find, take +1

If you have a useful reputation around these parts take an additional
+1. ***On a 10+*** you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled
applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them
along. ***On a 7–9*** you’ll have to settle for someone close or turn
them away. On a miss someone influential and ill- suited declares
they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a
veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or
turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to
Recruit.

## Outstanding Warrants

When you **return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble
before**, roll+Cha. ***On a 10+***, word has spread of your deeds and
everyone recognizes you. ***On a 7–9***, that, and, the GM chooses a
complication:

* The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest
* Someone has put a price on your head
* Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of
your actions

## Bolster

When you **spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard
practice,** you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or two, 1
preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, 3 preparation. When
your preparation pays off spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll. You
can only spend one preparation per roll.

* [ ] Chaotic: You eschew a convention of the civilized world.
* [ ] Neutral: Teach someone the ways of your people.

human, but you and your people are not from around here. At the
beginning of each session, the GM will ask you something about your
homeland, why you left, or what you left behind. If you answer them,
mark XP.

Fill in the name of one of your companions in at least one:

* \_______________ is puny and foolish, but amusing to me.
* \_______________'s ways are strange and confusing.
* \_______________ is always getting into trouble—I must protect them

## Gear

Your Load is 8+Str. You carry dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight), a
dagger (hand, 1 weight) some token of where you’ve traveled or where
you’re from, and your choice of weapon:

* [ ] Axe (close, 1 weight)
* [ ] Two handed sword (close, +1 damage, 2 weight)

Choose one:

* [ ] Adventuring gear (1 weight) and dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight)
* [ ] Chainmail (1 armor, 1 weight)

## Class Moves

You start with all of these moves:

## Herculean Appetites

Others may content themselves with just a taste of wine, or dominion
over a servant or two, but you want more. Choose two appetites. While
pursuing one of your appetites if you would roll for a move, instead of
rolling 2d6 you roll 1d6+1d8. If the d6 is the higher die of the pair,
the GM will also introduce a complication or danger that comes about
due to your heedless pursuits.

* [ ] Pure destruction
* [ ] Power over others
* [ ] Mortal pleasures
* [ ] Conquest
* [ ] Riches and property
* [ ] Fame and glory

## The Upper Hand

You take +1 ongoing to last breath rolls. When you take your last
breath, on a 7–9 you make an offer to Death in return for your life. If
Death accepts he will return you to life. If not, you die.

## Musclebound

While you wield a weapon it gains the forceful and messy tags.

## What Are You Waiting For?

When you cry out a challenge to your enemies, roll+Con. ***On a 10+***
they treat you as the most obvious threat to be dealt with and ignore
your companions, take +2 damage ongoing against them. ***On a 7–9***
only a few (the weakest or most foolhardy among them) fall prey to your
taunting.

In addition, choose one of these to start with:

## [ ] Full Plate and Packing Steel

You ignore the clumsy tag on armor you wear.

-OR-

## [ ] Unencumbered, Unharmed

So long as you are below your Load and neither wear armor nor carry a
shield, take +1 armor. Advanced Moves

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Still Hungry: Choose an additional appetite.

* [ ] Appetite for Destruction: Take a move from the fighter, bard or
thief class list. You may not take multiclass moves from those classes.

* [ ] My Love For You Is Like a Truck: When you perform a feat of
strength, name someone present whom you have impressed and take +1
forward to parley with them.

* [ ] What Is Best In Life: At the end of a session, if during this
session you have crushed your enemies, seen them driven before you, or
have heard the lamentations of their kinfolk mark XP.

* [ ] Wide Wanderer: You’ve traveled the wide world over. When you
arrive someplace ask the GM about any important traditions, rituals,
and so on, they’ll tell you what you need to know.

* [ ] Usurper: When you prove yourself superior to a person in power,
take +1 forward with their followers, underlings, and hangers on. Khan
of

* [ ] Khans: Your hirelings always accept the gratuitous fulfillment of
one of your appetites as payment.

* [ ] Samson: You may take a debility to immediately break free of any
physical or mental restraint.

* [ ] Smash!: When you hack and slash, on a 12+ deal your damage and
choose something physical your target has (a weapon, their position, a
limb): they lose it.

* [ ] Indestructible Hunger: When you take damage you can choose to
take -1 ongoing until you sate one of your appetites instead of taking
the damage. If you already have this penalty you cannot choose this
option.

* [ ] Eye for Weakness: When you discern realities add “What here is
weak or vulnerable?” to the list of questions you can ask.

* [ ] On the Move: When you defy a danger caused by movement (maybe
falling off a narrow bridge or rushing past an armed guard) take +1.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level
2–5 moves.

* [ ] A Good Day to Die: As long as you have less than your Con in
current HP (or 1, whichever is higher) take +1 ongoing.

* [ ] Kill ‘em All (Requires: Appetite for Destruction): Take another
move from the fighter, bard or thief class list. You may not take
multiclass moves from those classes.

* [ ] War Cry: When you enter battle with a show of force (a shout, a
rallying cry, a battle dance) roll+Cha. ***On a 10+*** both, ***On a
7–9*** one or the other. 1) Your allies are rallied and take +1
forward. 2) Your enemies feel fear and act accordingly (avoiding you,
hiding, attacking with fear driven abandon)

* [ ] Mark of Might: When you take this move and spend some
uninterrupted time reflecting on your past glories you may mark
yourself with a symbol of your power (a long braid tied with bells,
ritual scars or tattoos, etc.) Any intelligent mortal creature who sees
this symbol knows instinctively that you are a force to be reckoned
with and treats you appropriately.

* [ ] More! Always More!: When you satisfy an appetite to the extreme
(destroying something unique and significant, gaining enormous fame,
riches, power, etc.) you may choose to resolve it. Cross it off the
list and mark XP. While you may pursue that appetite again, you no
longer feel the burning desire you once did. In its place, choose a new
appetite from the list or write your own.

* [ ] The One Who Knocks: When you defy danger, on a 12+ you turn the
danger back on itself, the GM will describe how.

* [ ] Healthy Distrust: Whenever the unclean magic wielded by mortal
men causes you to defy danger, treat any result of 6 as a 7–9.

* [ ] For the Blood God: You are initiated in the old ways, the ways of
sacrifice. Choose something your gods (or the ancestor spirits, or your
totem, etc) value—gold, blood, bones or the like. When you sacrifice
those things as per your rites and rituals, roll+Wis. ***On a 10+***
the GM will grant you insight into your current trouble or a boon to
help you. ***On a 7–9*** the sacrifice is not enough and your gods take
of your flesh as well, but still grant you some insight or boon. ***On
a miss***, you earn the ire of the fickle spirits.

* +1d4 forward to damage
* Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment
* The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they
get +2 instead of +1.

Then roll+Cha. ***On a 10+***, the ally gets the selected effect. ***On
a 7-9*** your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or
your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s
choice.

you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.

## Charming and Open

When you **speak frankly with someone**, you can ask their player a

may ask you a question from the list (which you must answer
truthfully).

* What are you really feeling right now?
* What do you most desire?

righteous lute solo or mighty brass blast, maybe) choose a target who
can hear you and roll+Cha. ***On a 10+*** the target attacks their
nearest ally in range. ***On a 7–9:*** they attack their nearest ally,
but you also draw their attention and ire.

* [ ] Metal Hurlant: When you **shout with great force or play a
shattering note** choose a target and roll+Con. ***On a 10+*** the
target takes 1d10 damage and is deafened for a few minutes. ***On a
7–9:*** you still damage your target, but it’s out of control: the GM
will choose an additional target nearby.

about you. ***On a 7-9***, tell the GM one thing they’ve heard, and the
GM tells you one thing.

* [ ] Eldritch Chord (Replaces: Eldritch Tones): When you use arcane
art, you choose two effects. You also get to choose one of those
effects to double.

* [ ] An Ear For Magic: When you **hear an enemy cast a spell** the GM
will tell you the name of the spell and its effects. Take +1 forward
when acting on the answers.

slash, you take +2 armor forward.

level as one lower for choosing the move.

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Deity

You serve and worship some deity or power which grants you spells. Give
your god a name (maybe Helferth, Sucellus, Zorica or Krugon the Bleak)
and choose your deity’s domain:

* [ ] Healing and Restoration
* [ ] Bloody Conquest
* [ ] Civilization
* [ ] Knowledge and Hidden Things
* [ ] The Downtrodden and Forgotten
* [ ] What Lies Beneath

Choose one precept of your religion:

* [ ] Your religion preaches the sanctity of suffering, add Petition:
Suffering.
* [ ] Your religion is cultish and insular, add Petition: Gaining
Secrets.
* [ ] Your religion has important sacrificial rites, add Petition:
Offering.
* [ ] Your religion believes in trial by combat, add Petition: Personal
Victory

## Divine Guidance

When you **petition your deity according to the precept of your
religion**, you are granted some useful knowledge or boon related to
your deity’s domain. The GM will tell you what.

## Turn Undead

When you **hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for
protection**, roll+Wis. ✴On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and
brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. ✴On
a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless
undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act
as normal. Intelligent undead may still find ways to harry you from
afar. They’re clever like that.

## Commune

When you **spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet communion
with your deity**, you:

* Lose any spells already granted to you.
* Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed
your own level+1, and none of which is a higher level than your own
level.
* Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell

When you **unleash a spell granted to you by your deity**, roll+Wis.
***On a 10+***, the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not
revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. ***On a 7–9***, the spell
is cast, but choose one:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
tell you how.
* Your casting distances you from your deity—take -1 ongoing to cast a
spell until the next time you commune.
* After you cast it, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot
cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause
a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Chosen One: Choose one spell. You are granted that spell as if it
was one level lower.

* [ ] Invigorate: When you **heal someone** they take +2 forward to
their damage.

* [ ] The Scales of Life and Death: When **someone takes their last
breath in your presence**, they take +1 to the roll.

* [ ] Serenity: When you cast a spell you ignore the first -1 penalty
from ongoing spells.

* [ ] First Aid: Cure Light Wounds is a rote for you, and therefore
doesn’t count against your limit of granted spells.

* [ ] Divine Intervention: When you commune you get 1 hold and lose any
hold you already had. Spend that hold when you or an ally takes damage
to call on your deity, they intervene with an appropriate manifestation
(a sudden gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light) and negate the
damage.

* [ ] Penitent: When you **take damage and embrace the pain**, you may
take +1d4 damage (ignoring armor). If you do, take +1 forward to cast a
spell.

* [ ] Empower: When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the option of
choosing from the 7–9 list. If you do, you may choose one of these
effects as well: 1) The spell’s effects are doubled. 2) The spell’s
targets are doubled.

* [ ] Orison for Guidance: When you **sacrifice something of value to
your deity and pray for guidance**, your deity tells you what it would
have you do. If you do it, mark experience.

* [ ] Divine Protection: When you wear no armor or shield you get 2
armor.

* [ ] Devoted Healer: When you heal someone else of damage, add your
level to the amount of damage healed.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level
2–5 moves.

* [ ] Anointed (Requires: Chosen One): Choose one spell in addition to
the one you picked for chosen one. You are granted that spell as if it
was one level lower.

* [ ] Apotheosis: The first time you **spend time in prayer as
appropriate to your god** after taking this move, choose a feature
associated with your deity (rending claws, wings of sapphire feathers,
an all-seeing third eye, etc.). When you emerge from prayer, you
permanently gain that physical feature.

* [ ] Reaper: When you **take time after a conflict to dedicate your
victory to your deity and deal with the dead**, take +1 forward.

* [ ] Providence (Replaces: Serenity): You ignore the -1 penalty from
two spells you maintain.

* [ ] Greater First Aid (Requires: First Aid): Cure Moderate Wounds is
a rote for you, and therefore doesn’t count against your limit of
granted spells.

* [ ] Divine Invincibility (Replaces: Divine Intervention): When you
commune you gain 2 hold and lose any hold you already had. Spend that
hold when you or an ally takes damage to call on your deity, who
intervenes with an appropriate manifestation (a sudden gust of wind, a
lucky slip, a burst of light) and negates the damage.

* [ ] Martyr (Replaces: Penitent): When you **take damage and embrace
the pain**, you may take +1d4 damage (ignoring armor). If you do, take
+1 forward to cast a spell and add your level to any damage done or
healed by the spell.

* [ ] Divine Armor (Replaces: Divine Protection): When you wear no
armor or shield you get 3 armor.

* [ ] Greater Empower (Replaces: Empower): When you cast a spell, on a
10–11 you have the option of choosing from the 7–9 list. If you do, you
may choose one of these effects as well. On a 12+ you get to choose one
of these effects for free: 1) The spell’s effects are doubled. 2) The
spell’s targets are doubled.

* [ ] Multiclass Dabbler: Get one move from another class. Treat your
level as one lower for choosing the move.

# Cleric Spells

## Rotes

Every time you commune, you gain access to all of your rotes without
having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.

* Light Rote: An item you touch glows with divine light, about as
bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel
but is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of the
color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your presence.

* Sanctify Rote: Food or water you hold in your hands while you cast
this spell is consecrated by your deity. In addition to now being holy
or unholy, the affected substance is purified of any mundane spoilage.

* Guidance Rote: The symbol of your deity appears before you and
gestures towards the direction or course of action your deity would
have you take then disappears. The message is through gesture only;
your communication through this spell is severely limited.

## Level 1 Spells

* [ ] Bless (Level 1 *Ongoing*): Your deity smiles upon a combatant of
your choice. They take +1 ongoing so long as battle continues and they
stand and fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a
spell.

* [ ] Cure Light Wounds (Level 1): At your touch wounds scab and bones
cease to ache. Heal an ally you touch of 1d8 damage.

* [ ] Detect Alignment (Level 1): When you cast this spell choose an
alignment: Good, Evil, Lawful, or Chaotic. One of your senses is
briefly able to detect that alignment. The GM will tell you what here
is of that alignment.

* [ ] Cause Fear (Level 1 *Ongoing*): Choose a target you can see and a
nearby object. The target is afraid of the object so long as you
maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to them: flee, panic, beg,
fight. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. You
cannot target entities with less than animal intelligence (magical
constructs, undead, automatons, and the like).

* [ ] Magic Weapon (Level 1 *Ongoing*): The weapon you hold while
casting does +1d4 damage until you dismiss this spell. While this spell
is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Sanctuary (Level 1): As you cast this spell, you walk the
perimeter of an area, consecrating it to your deity. As long as you
stay within that area you are alerted whenever someone acts with malice
within the sanctuary (including entering with harmful intent). Anyone
who receives healing within a sanctuary heals +1d4 HP.

* [ ] Speak With Dead (Level 1): A corpse converses with you briefly.
It will answer any three questions you pose to it to the best of the
knowledge it had in life and the knowledge it gained in death.

## Level 3 Spells

* [ ] Animate Dead (Level 3 *Ongoing*): You invoke a hungry spirit to
possess a recently-dead body and serve you. This creates a zombie that
follows your orders to the best of its limited abilities. Treat the
zombie as a character, but with access to only the basic moves. It has
a +1 modifier for all stats and 1 HP. The zombie lasts until it is
destroyed by taking damage in excess of its HP, or until you end the
spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell. The
zombie also gets your choice of 1d4 of these traits: 1) It’s talented.
Give one stat a +2 modifier. 2) It’s durable. It has +2 HP for each
level you have. 3) It has a functioning brain and can complete complex
tasks. 4) It does not appear obviously dead, at least for a day or two.

* [ ] Cure Moderate Wounds (Level 3): You staunch bleeding and set
bones through magic. Heal an ally you touch of 2d8 damage.

* [ ] Darkness (Level 3 *Ongoing*): Choose an area you can see: it’s
filled with supernatural darkness and shadow. While this spell is
ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Resurrection (Level 3): Tell the GM you would like to resurrect a
corpse whose soul has not yet fully departed this world. Resurrection
is always possible, but the GM will give you one or more (possibly all)
of these conditions to fulfill. The GM may, depending on the
circumstances, allow you to resurrect the corpse now, with the
understanding that the conditions must be met before it’s permanent, or
require you to meet the conditions before the corpse is resurrected. 1)
It’s going to take days/weeks/months. 2) You must get help from
\_______________. 3) It will require a lot of money. 4) You must
sacrifice \_______________ to do it.

* [ ] Hold Person (Level 3): Choose a person you can see. Until you
cast a spell or leave their presence they cannot act except to speak.
This effect ends immediately if the target takes damage from any
source.

## Level 5 Spells

* [ ] Revelation (Level 5): Your deity answers your prayers with a
moment of perfect understanding. The GM will shed light on the current
situation. When acting on the information, you take +1 forward.

* [ ] Cure Critical Wounds (Level 5): Heal an ally you touch of 3d8
damage.

* [ ] Divination (Level 5): Name a person, place, or thing you want to
learn about. Your deity grants you visions of the target, as clear as
if you were there.

* [ ] Contagion (Level 5 *Ongoing*): Choose a creature you can see.
Until you end this spell, the target suffers from a disease of your
choice. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Words of the Unspeaking (Level 5): With a touch you speak to the
spirits within things. The non-living object you touch answers three
questions you pose, as best it can.

* [ ] True Seeing (Level 5 *Ongoing*): Your vision is opened to the
true nature of everything you lay your eyes on. You pierce illusions
and see things that have been hidden. The GM will describe the area
before you ignoring any illusions and falsehoods, magical or otherwise.
While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Trap Soul (Level 5): You trap the soul of a dying creature within
a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still
be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves
against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any
time but it can never be recaptured once freed.

## Level 7 Spells

* [ ] Word of Recall (Level 7): Choose a word. The first time after
casting this spell that you speak the chosen word, you and any allies
touching you when you cast the spell are immediately returned to the
exact spot where you cast the spell. You can only maintain a single
location; casting Word of Recall again before speaking the word
replaces the earlier spell.

* [ ] Heal (Level 7): Touch an ally and you may heal their damage a
number of points up to your maximum HP.

* [ ] Harm (Level 7): Touch an enemy and strike them with divine
wrath—deal 2d8 damage to them and 1d6 damage to yourself. This damage
ignores armor.

* [ ] Sever (Level 7 *Ongoing*): Choose an appendage on the target such
as an arm, tentacle, or wing. The appendage is magically severed from
their body, causing no damage but considerable pain. Missing an
appendage may, for example, keep a winged creature from flying, or a
bull from goring you on its horns. While this spell is ongoing you take
-1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Mark of Death (Level 7): Choose a creature whose true name you
know. This spell creates permanent runes on a target surface that will
kill that creature, should they read them.

* [ ] Control Weather (Level 7): Pray for rain—or sun, wind, or snow.
Within a day or so, your god will answer. The weather will change
according to your will and last a handful of days.

## Level 9 Spells

* [ ] Storm of Vengeance (Level 9): Your deity brings the unnatural
weather of your choice to pass. Rain of blood or acid, clouds of souls,
wind that can carry away buildings, or any other weather you can
imagine: ask and it shall come.

* [ ] Repair (Level 9): Choose one event in the target’s past. All
effects of that event, including damage, poison, disease, and magical
effects, are ended and repaired. HP and diseases are healed, poisons
are neutralized, magical effects are ended.

* [ ] Divine Presence (Level 9 *Ongoing*): Every creature must ask your
leave to enter your presence, and you must give permission aloud for
them to enter. Any creature without your leave takes an extra 1d10
damage whenever they take damage in your presence. While this spell is
ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Consume Unlife (Level 9): The mindless undead creature you touch
is destroyed and you steal its death energy to heal yourself or the
next ally you touch. The amount of damage healed is equal to the HP
that the creature had remaining before you destroyed it.

* [ ] Plague Level (9 *Ongoing*): Name a city, town, encampment, or
other place where people live. As long as this spell is active that
place is beset by a plague appropriate to your deity’s domains
(locusts, death of the first born, etc.) While this spell is ongoing
you take -1 to cast a spell.

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Born of the Soil

You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient
and they’ve marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go,
they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of
the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when
shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in
your Land.

* [ ] The Great Forests
* [ ] The Whispering Plains
* [ ] The Vast Desert
* [ ] The Stinking Mire
* [ ] The River Delta
* [ ] The Depths of the Earth
* [ ] The Sapphire Islands
* [ ] The Open Sea
* [ ] The Towering Mountains
* [ ] The Frozen North
* [ ] The Blasted Wasteland

Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the
soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature
like antlers or leopard’s spots or something more general: hair like
leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what
shape you take.

## By Nature Sustained

You don’t need to eat or drink. If a move tells you to mark off a
ration just ignore it.

## Spirit Tongue

The grunts, barks, chirps, and calls of the creatures of the wild are
as language to you. You can understand any animal native to your land
or akin to one whose essence you have studied.

## Shapeshifter

When you call upon the spirits to change your shape, roll+Wis. ***On a
10+*** hold 3. ***On a 7–9*** hold 2. ✴On a miss hold 1 in addition to
whatever the GM says.

You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have
studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a
perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and
weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of
air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to
trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM
will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form.
Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you’re out of hold, you return to
your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert
to your natural form.

Common Animal Moves

* Pack Hunters: 1)Summon the pack. 2) Drag them to the ground.
* Flying Creatures: 1) Escape to the air. 2) Pull an enemy aloft.
* Hardy Beasts: 1) Trample them. 2) Break through.
* Poisonous: 1) Inflict your poison on them. 2) Drive them back.

## Studied Essence

When you **spend time in contemplation of an animal spirit**, you may
add its species to those you can assume using shapeshifting.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Hunter’s Brother: Choose one move from the ranger class list.

* [ ] Red of Tooth and Claw: When you **are in an appropriate animal
form** (something dangerous) increase your damage to d8.

* [ ] Communion of Whispers: When **you spend time in a place, making
note of its resident spirits and calling on the spirits of the land**,
roll+Wis. You will be granted a vision of significance to you, your
allies, and the spirits around you. ***On a 10+*** the vision will be
clear and helpful to you. ***On a 7–9*** the vision is unclear, its
meaning murky. ✴On a miss, the vision is upsetting, frightening, or
traumatizing. The GM will describe it. Take -1 forward.

* [ ] Barkskin: So long as your feet touch the ground you have +1
armor.

* [ ] Eyes of the Tiger: When you mark an animal (with mud, dirt, or
blood) you can see through that animal’s eyes as if they were your own,
no matter what distance separates you. Only one animal at a time may be
marked in this way.

* [ ] Shed: When you **take damage while shapeshifted** you may choose
to revert to your natural form to negate the damage.

* [ ] Thing-Talker: You see the spirits in the sand, the sea and the
stone. You may now apply your spirit tongue, shapeshifting and studied
essence to inanimate natural objects (plants and rocks) or creatures
made thereof, as well as animals. Thing- talker forms can be exact
copies or can be mobile vaguely humanoid-shaped entities.

* [ ] Formcrafter: When you shapeshift choose a stat: you take +1
ongoing to rolls using that stat while shifted. The GM will choose a
stat, too: you take -1 ongoing to rolls using that stat while shifted.

* [ ] Elemental Mastery: When you **call on the primal spirits of fire,
water, earth or air to perform a task for you** 1) The effect you
desire comes to pass. 2) You avoid paying nature’s price. 3) You retain
control. roll+Wis. ***On a 10+*** choose two. ***On a 7–9*** choose
one. ✴On a miss, some catastrophe occurs as a result of your calling.

* [ ] Balance: When you **deal damage**, take 1 balance. When you touch
someone and channel the spirits of life you may spend balance. For each
balance spent, heal 1d4 HP.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level
2–5 moves.

* [ ] Embracing No Form: When you shapeshift, roll 1d4 and add that
total to your hold.

* [ ] Doppelgänger’s Dance: You are able to study the essence of
specific individuals to take their exact form, including men, elves, or
the like. Suppressing your tell is possible, but if you do, take -1
ongoing until you return to your own form.

* [ ] Blood and Thunder (Replaces: Red of Tooth and Claw): When you
**are in an appropriate animal form** (something dangerous) increase
your damage to d10.

* [ ] The Druid Sleep: When you take this move, the next opportunity
that you have safety and time to spend in an appropriate location, you
may attune yourself to a new land. This effect occurs only once and the
GM will tell you how long it will take and what cost you must pay. From
then on, you are considered to be born of the soil in both lands.

* [ ] World-Talker (Requires: Thing-Talker): You see the patterns that
make up the fabric of the world. You may now apply your spirit tongue,
shapeshifter and studied essence moves to pure elements—fire, water,
air and earth.

* [ ] Stalker’s Sister: Choose one move from the ranger class list.

* [ ] Formshaper (Requires: Formcrafter): You may increase your armor
by 1 or deal an additional +1d4 damage while in an animal form. Choose
which when you shapeshift.

* [ ] Chimera: When you shapeshift, you may create a merged form of up
to three different shapes. You may be a bear with the wings of an eagle
and the head of a ram, for example. Each feature will grant you a
different move to make. Your chimera form follows the same rules as
shapeshifter otherwise.

* [ ] Weather Weaver: When you are under open skies when the sun rises
the GM will ask you what the weather will be that day. Tell them
whatever you like, it comes to pass.

* I cast something into the fire for \_______________ and still owe
them their due.

## Gear

Your Load is 9+STR.

You carry no weapon and need no armor but the flames the burn within
you. You begin with a symbol of your sacrifices past, Adventuring Gear
(5 uses, 1 weight) and 1 healing potion. Then choose two:

within you come to your aid. Roll 1d4 and either add that many uses to
your burning brand (if active), take that result forward to summon your
burning brand, or reduce the damage by that amount, your choice.

## Control Flame

When you bend non-magical flame to your will, roll+WIS. ***On a 10+***
it does as you command, taking the shape and movement you desire for as
long as it has fuel on which to burn. ***On a 7-9*** the effect is
short-lived, lasting only a moment.

## Personal Incandescence

When you gaze intensely into someone eyes, you may ask their player
“what fuels the flames of your desire?” Roll+CHA. ***On a 10+***
they’ll answer with the truth, even if the character does not know or
would otherwise keep this hidden. ***On a 7-9*** they will answer, but
you are also compelled to answer.

## Hand Crafted

You may use your hands in place of tools and fire
to craft metal objects. Mundane weapons, armor and metal jewelry can
all be formed from their raw components. You may unmake these things,

Defy Danger first.

When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Lore of Flame: When you stare into a source of fire, looking for
answers, roll+WIS ***On a 10+***, the GM will tell you something new
and interesting about the current situation. On a 10+, the GM will give
you good detail. ***On a 7–9***, the GM will give you an impression. If
you already know all there is to know, the GM will tell you that.

* [ ] Burns Twice as Bright: When you channel the flames of fate, you
may treat a missed roll as a 7-9 or a 7-9 result as a 10+. This may be
a roll you or another character has made. Tell the GM something you’ve
lost; an emotion, a memory or some innate piece of your being. You may
not use this move again until you’ve used Burns Half As Long.

* [ ] Burns Half as Long: You gain this move when you gain Burns Twice
as Bright. When you sacrifice a victory to the flames of fate, treat
any roll of 10+ as a miss.

* [ ] This Killing Fire: Add the following tags to your options for
Burning Brand: messy, forceful, reach, near, far.

* [ ] Firebrand: When you introduce a new idea to an NPC, roll+CHA.
***On a 10+*** They believe the idea to be their own and take to it
with fervor ***On a 7-9***, Their passion fades after a day or two. On
a miss, they respond negatively, speaking out against the idea.

* [ ] Ogdru Jahad: Gain the Wizard move Ritual. The GM will always tell
you what you have to sacrifice to gain the effect you desire.

* [ ] Moth to the Flame: When you tempt a weak mind with your inner
fire, roll+WIS. ***On a 10+*** their will is suppressed, they’ll follow
you and do as you desire, so long as nothing startles or surprises
them. ***On a 7-9***, the effect is only strong enough to distract or
confuse them. On a miss, they become agitated and upset, your fire
having sparked their hidden desires.

* [ ] Burning Bridges: When you would take your last breath,
roll+Bonds. ***On a 10+*** you don't have to roll Last Breath. You may
erase one of your Bonds. This is permanent and lowers your total
available Bonds forever. You are alive and have 1d6 hp. ***On a 7-9***,
you must roll Last Breath, but take a +1. ***On a 6-*** take your last
breath as normal.

* [ ] The Enkindler: When you bolster the courage of others roll+CHA.
***On a 10+*** they shake off all fear and doubt, becoming brave in an
instant. ***On a 7-9***, this effect is fleeting, they realize its
superficiality and resort to cowardice after a moment or two. On a
miss, they’re cowed or terrified by your presence.

* [ ] Sick Burn: When you insult an NPC, roll + CHA. ***On a 10+*** you
leave them no room to react, they bear your insult and the scorn of all
who hear it. ***On a 7-9*** you cross a line, they will have their
revenge, someday. On a miss you’ve gone too far, they blow up here and
now.

When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level
2-5 moves.

* [ ] From Hell’s Heart: Whenever you summon fire with any of your
moves, you can replace it with the black fires of hell itself. This
fire does not burn with heat and ignores armor, scorching the soul
itself. Those creatures without souls cannot be harmed by this type of
flame.

* [ ] Burning Ring Of Fire: When you fuse a willing person’s soul to
yours, roll+CHA. ***On a 10+*** you are bound together, able to sense
each other at any distance, as well as sharing your emotional state.
***On a 7-9***, the connection is unstable and dangerous, when you take
a debility, so do they (and vice versa). ***On a 6-***, the branding is
rejected and you both erase any Bonds you have to each other. You may
write new Bonds with them at the End of Session as usual. This fusion,
once performed, cannot be undone by mortal means.

* [ ] Fanning the Flames (Requires: Firebrand): You may apply the
effects of your Firebrand move to a group of people -- a dozen or so --
all at once.

* [ ] Watch the World Burn: When you open a channel to the burning
planes and call a firestorm, tell the GM what you’re sacrificing and
roll+WIS. The sky opens up and fire pours like rain from it within an
area about equal to a small village. Everyone and everything in the
area takes damage as appropriate. ***On a 10+*** you can extinguish the
storm with a little effort. ***On a 7-9*** the fires rage out of your
control, spreading and gusting where they are carried by wind and
weather. On a miss, something cruel, intelligent and hungry comes with
the storm.

* [ ] Blot Out the Sun: When you volley you may spend extra ammo before
rolling. For each point of ammo spent you may choose an extra target.
Roll once and apply damage to all targets.

* [ ] Well-Trained: Choose another training for your animal companion.

* [ ] God Amidst the Wastes: Dedicate yourself to a deity (name a new
one or choose one that’s already been established). You gain the
commune and cast a spell cleric moves. When you select this move, treat
yourself as a cleric of level 1 for using spells. Every time you gain a
level thereafter, increase your effective cleric level by 1.

* [ ] Follow Me: When you undertake a perilous journey you can take two
roles. You make a separate roll for each.

* [ ] A Safe Place: When you **set the watch for the night**, everyone
takes +1 to take watch.

When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level
2-5
moves.

understand any non-magical, non-planar creature.

* [ ] Hunter’s Prey (Replaces: Familiar Prey): When you spout lore
about a monster you use WIS instead of INT. On a 12+, in addition to
the normal effects, you get to ask the GM any one question about the
subject.

* [ ] Viper’s Fangs (Replaces: Viper’s Strike): When you strike an
enemy with two weapons at once, add an extra 1d8 damage for your
off-hand strike.

* [ ] Smaug’s Belly: When you know your target’s weakest point your
arrows have 2 piercing.

journey you can take two roles. Roll twice and use the better result
for both roles.

for the night everyone takes +1 to take watch. After a night in camp
when you set the watch everyone takes +1 forward.

* [ ] Observant: When you hunt and track, on a hit you may also ask one
question about the creature you are tracking from the discern realities
list for free.

are working with your animal companion you have access to that move.

* [ ] Unnatural Ally: Your animal companion is a monster, not an
animal. Describe it. Give it +2 ferocity and +1 instinct, plus a new
training.

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Trap Expert

When you **spend a moment to survey a dangerous area**, roll+DEX. ***On
a 10+***, hold 3. ***On a 7–9***, hold 1. Spend your hold as you walk
through the area to ask these questions:

* Is there a trap here and if so, what activates it?
* What does the trap do when activated?
* What else is hidden here?

## Tricks of the Trade

When you **pick locks or pockets or disable traps**, roll+DEX. ***On a
10+***, you do it, no problem. ***On a 7–9***, you still do it, but the
GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.

* Reduce their armor by 1 until they repair it

## Flexible Morals

When someone tries to detect your alignment you can tell them any
alignment you like.

## Poisoner

You’ve mastered the care and use of a poison. Choose a poison from the
list below; that poison is no longer dangerous for you to use. You also
start with three uses of the poison you choose. Whenever you have time
to gather materials and a safe place to brew you can make three uses of
the poison you choose for free. Note that some poisons are applied,
meaning you have to carefully apply it to the target or something they
eat or drink. Touch poisons just need to touch the target, they can
even be used on the blade of a weapon.

* Oil of Tagit (applied): The target falls into a light sleep.
* Bloodweed (touch): The target deals -1d4 damage ongoing until cured.
* Goldenroot (applied): The target treats the next creature they see as
a trusted ally, until proved otherwise.
* Serpent’s Tears (touch): Anyone dealing damage to the target rolls
twice and takes the better result.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2–5, choose from these moves.

* [ ] Cheap Shot: When using a precise or hand weapon, your backstab
deals an extra +1d6 damage.

* [ ] Cautious: When you use trap expert you always get +1 hold, even
on a 6-.

* [ ] Wealth and Taste: When you **make a show of flashing around your
most valuable possession**, choose someone present. They will do
anything they can to obtain your item or one like it.

* [ ] Shoot First: You’re never caught by surprise. When an enemy would
get the drop on you, you get to act first instead.

* [ ] Poison Master: After you’ve used a poison once it’s no longer
dangerous for you to use.

* [ ] Envenom: You can apply even complex poisons with a pinprick. When
you apply a poison that’s not dangerous for you to use to your weapon
it’s touch instead of applied.

* [ ] Brewer: When you have time to gather materials and a safe place
to brew you can create three doses of any one poison you’ve used
before.

* [ ] Underdog: When you’re outnumbered, you have +1 armor.

* [ ] Connections: When you put out word to the criminal underbelly
about something you want or need, roll+CHA. ***On a 10+***, someone has
it, just for you. ***On a 7–9***, you’ll have to settle for something
close or it comes with strings attached, your call.

When you gain a level from 6–10, choose from these moves or the level
2–5 moves.

* [ ] Dirty Fighter (Replaces: Cheap Shot): When using a precise or
hand weapon, your backstab deals an extra +1d8 damage and all other
attacks deal +1d4 damage.

* [ ] Extremely Cautious (Replaces: Cautious): When you use trap expert
you always get +1 hold, even on a 6-. On a 12+ you get 3 hold and the
next time you come near a trap the GM will immediately tell you what it
does, what triggers it, who set it, and how you can use it to your
advantage.

* [ ] Alchemist (Replaces: Brewer): When you have you have time to
gather materials and a safe place to brew you can create three doses of
any poison you’ve used before. Alternately you can describe the effects
of a poison you’d like to create. The GM will tell you that you can
create it, but with one or more caveats: 1) It will only work under
specific circumstances. 2) The best you can manage is a weaker version.
3) It’ll take a while to take effect. 4) It’ll have obvious side
effects.

* [ ] Serious Underdog (Replaces: Underdog): You have +1 armor. When
you’re outnumbered, you have +2 armor instead.

* [ ] Evasion: When you defy danger on a 12+, you transcend the danger.
You not only do what you set out to, but the GM will offer you a better
outcome, true beauty, or a moment of grace.

* [ ] Strong Arm, True Aim: You can throw any melee weapon, using it to
volley. A thrown melee weapon is gone; you can never choose to reduce
ammo on a 7–9.

* [ ] Escape Route: When you’re in too deep and need a way out, name
your escape route and roll+DEX. ***On a 10+*** [ ] you’re gone. ***On a
7–9*** [ ] you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave
something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.

* [ ] Disguise: When you have time and materials you can create a
disguise that will fool anyone into thinking you’re another creature of
about the same size and shape. Your actions can give you away but your
appearance won’t.

* [ ] Heist: When you take time to make a plan to steal something, name
the thing you want to steal and ask the GM these questions. When acting
on the answers you and your allies take +1 forward. (Who will notice
it’s missing? What’s its most powerful defense? Who will come after it?
Who else wants it?)

teach them all that I can.

## Gear

Your load is 7+Str. You start with your spellbook (1 weight) and
dungeon rations (5 uses, 1 weight). Choose your defenses:

* [ ] Leather armor (1 armor, 1 weight)
* [ ] Bag of books (5 uses, 2 weight) and 3 healing potions

Choose your weapon:

* [ ] Dagger (hand, 1 weight)
* [ ] Staff (close, two-handed, 1 weight)

Choose one:

* [ ] Healing potion (0 weight)
* [ ] 3 antitoxins (0 weight)

## Class Moves

You start with these moves:

## Spellbook

You have mastered several spells and inscribed them in your spellbook.
You start out with three first level spells in your spellbook as well
as the cantrips. Whenever you gain a level, you add a new spell of your
level or lower to your spellbook. You spellbook is 1 weight.

## Prepare Spells

When you **spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in quiet
contemplation of your spellbook**, you:

* Lose any spells you already have prepared
* Prepare new spells of your choice from your spellbook whose total
levels don’t exceed your own level+1.
* Prepare your cantrips which never count against your limit.

## Cast a Spell (Int)

When you **release a spell you’ve prepared**, roll+Int. ***On a 10+***,
the spell is successfully cast and you do not forget the spell—you may
cast it again later. ***On a 7-9***, the spell is cast, but choose one:

* You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
tell you how.
* The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast—take -1
ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
* After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell
again until you prepare spells.

Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause
a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

## Spell Defense

You may end any ongoing spell immediately and use the energy of its
dissipation to deflect an oncoming attack. The spell ends and you
subtract its level from the damage done to you.

## Ritual

When you **draw on a place of power to create a magical effect**, tell
the GM what you’re trying to achieve. Ritual effects are always
possible, but the GM will give you one to four of the following
conditions:

* It’s going to take days/weeks/months.
* First you must \_______________.
* You’ll need help from \_______________.
* It will require a lot of money.
* The best you can do is a lesser version, unreliable and limited.
* You and your allies will risk danger from \_______________.
* You’ll have to disenchant \_______________  to do it.

## Advanced Moves

When you gain a level from 2-5, choose from these moves. You also add a
new spell to your spellbook at each level.

* [ ] Prodigy: Choose a spell. You prepare that spell as if it were one
level lower.

* [ ] Empowered Magic: When you cast a spell, on a 10+ you have the
option of choosing from the 7-9 list. If you do, you may choose one of
these as well: 1) The spell’s effects are maximized. 2) The spell’s
targets are doubled.

* [ ] Fount of Knowledge: When you **spout lore about something no one
else has any clue about**, take +1.

* [ ] Know-It-All: When **another player’s character comes to you for
advice and you tell them what you think is best**, they get +1 forward
when following your advice and you mark experience if they do.

* [ ] Expanded Spellbook: Add a new spell from the spell list of any
class to your spellbook.

* [ ] Enchanter: When you have time and safety with a magic item you
may ask the GM what it does, the GM will answer you truthfully.

* [ ] Logical: When you **use strict deduction to analyze your
surroundings**, you can discern realities with INT instead of WIS.

* [ ] Arcane Ward: As long as you have at least one prepared spell of
first level or higher, you have +2 armor.

* [ ] Counterspell: When you **attempt to counter an arcane spell that
will otherwise affect you**, stake one of your prepared spells on the
defense and roll+Int. ***On a 10+***, the spell is countered and has no
effect on you. ***On a 7-9***, the spell is countered and you forget
the spell you staked. Your counterspell protects only you; if the
countered spell has other targets they get its effects.

* [ ] Quick Study: When you **see the effects of an arcane spell**, ask
the GM the name of the spell and its effects. You take +1 when acting
on the answers.

When you gain a level from 6-10, choose from these moves or the level 2-5
moves.

* [ ] Master (Requires: Prodigy): Choose one spell in addition to the
one you picked for prodigy. You prepare that spell as if it were one
level lower.

* [ ] Greater Empowered Magic (Replaces: Empowered Magic): When you
cast a spell, on a 10-11 you have the option of choosing from the 7-9
list. If you do, you may choose one of these effects as well. On a 12+
you get to choose one of these effects for free: 1) The spell’s effects
are doubled. 2) The spell’s targets are doubled.

* [ ] Enchanter’s Soul (Requires: Enchanter): When you have time and
safety with a magic item in a place of power you can empower that item
so that the next time you use it its effects are amplified, the GM will
tell you exactly how.

* [ ] Highly Logical (Replaces: Logical): When you **use strict
deduction to analyze your surroundings**, you can discern realities
with Int instead of Wis. On a 12+ you get to ask the GM any three
questions, not limited by the list.

* [ ] Arcane Armor (Replaces: Arcane Ward): As long as you have at
least one prepared spell of first level or higher, you have +4 armor.

* [ ] Protective Counter (Requires: Counterspell): When an ally within
sight of you is affected by an arcane spell, you can counter it as if
it affected you. If the spell affects multiple allies you must counter
for each ally separately.

* [ ] Ethereal Tether: When you have time with a willing or helpless
subject you can craft an ethereal tether with them. You perceive what
they perceive and can discern realities about someone tethered to you
or their surroundings no matter the distance. Someone willingly
tethered to you can communicate with you over the tether as if you were
in the room with them.

* [ ] Mystical Puppet Strings: When you **use magic to control a
person’s actions** they have no memory of what you had them do and bear
you no ill will.

* [ ] Spell Augmentation: When you **deal damage to a creature** you
can shunt a spell’s energy into them—end one of your ongoing spells and
add the spell’s level to the damage dealt.

* [ ] Self-Powered: When you have time, arcane materials, and a safe
space, you can create your own place of power. Describe to the GM what
kind of power it is and how you’re binding it to this place, the GM
will tell you one kind of creature that will have an interest in your
workings.

# Wizard Spells

## Cantrips

You prepare all of your cantrips every time you prepare spells without
having to select them or count them toward your allotment of spells.

* Light (Cantrip): An item you touch glows with arcane light, about as
bright as a torch. It gives off no heat or sound and requires no fuel,
but it is otherwise like a mundane torch. You have complete control of
the color of the flame. The spell lasts as long as it is in your
presence.

* Unseen Servant (Cantrip *Ongoing*): You conjure a simple invisible
construct that can do nothing but carry items. It has load 3 and
carries anything you hand to it. It cannot pick up items on its own and
can only carry those you give to it. Items carried by an unseen servant
appear to float in the air a few paces behind you. An unseen servant
that takes damage or leaves your presence is immediately dispelled,
dropping any items it carried. Otherwise the unseen servant serves you
until you end the spell.

* Prestidigitation (Cantrip): You perform minor tricks of true magic.
If you touch an item as part of the casting you can make cosmetic
changes to it: clean it, soil it, cool it, warm it, flavor it, or
change its color. If you cast the spell without touching an item you
can instead create minor illusions no bigger than yourself.
Prestidigitation illusions are crude and clearly illusions—they won’t
fool anyone, but they might entertain them.

## Level 1 Spells

* [ ] Contact Spirits (Level 1 *Summoning*): Name the spirit you wish
to contact (or leave it to the GM). You pull that creature through the
planes, just close enough to speak to you. It is bound to answer any
one question you ask to the best of its ability.

* [ ] Detect Magic (Level 1 *Divination*): One of your senses is
briefly attuned to magic. The GM will tell you what here is magical.

* [ ] Telepathy (Level 1 *Divination Ongoing*): You form a telepathic
bond with a single person you touch, enabling you to converse with that
person through your thoughts. You can only have one telepathic bond at
a time.

* [ ] Charm Person (Level 1 *Enchantment Ongoing*) The person (not
beast or monster) you touch while casting this spell counts you as a
friend until they take damage or you prove otherwise.

* [ ] Invisibility Level 1 (*Illusion Ongoing*): Touch an ally: nobody
can see them. They’re invisible! The spell persists until the target
attacks or you dismiss the effect. While the spell is ongoing you can’t
cast a spell.

* [ ] Magic Missile (Level 1 *Evocation*): Projectiles of pure magic
spring from your fingers. Deal 2d4 damage to one target.

* [ ] Alarm (Level 1): Walk a wide circle as you cast this spell. Until
you prepare spells again your magic will alert you if a creature
crosses that circle. Even if you are asleep, the spell will shake you
from your slumber.

## Level 3 Spells

* [ ] Dispel Magic (Level 3): Choose a spell or magic effect in your
presence: this spell rips it apart. Lesser spells are ended, powerful
magic is just reduced or dampened so long as you are nearby.

* [ ] Visions Through Time (Level 3 *Divination*): Cast this spell and
gaze into a reflective surface to see into the depths of time. The GM
will reveal the details of a grim portent to you—a bleak event that
will come to pass without your intervention. They’ll tell you something
useful about how you can interfere with the grim portent’s dark
outcomes. Rare is the portent that claims “You’ll live happily ever
after.” Sorry.

* [ ] Fireball (Level 3 *Evocation*): You evoke a mighty ball of flame
that envelops your target and everyone nearby, inflicting 2d6 damage
which ignores armor.

* [ ] Mimic (Level 3 *Ongoing*): You take the form of someone you touch
while casting this spell. Your physical characteristics match theirs
exactly but your behavior may not. This change persists until you take
damage or choose to return to your own form. While this spell is
ongoing you lose access to all your wizard moves.

* [ ] Mirror Image (Level 3 *Illusion*): You create an illusory image
of yourself. When you are attacked, roll a d6. On a 4, 5, or 6 the
attack hits the illusion instead, the image then dissipates and the
spell ends.

* [ ] Sleep (Level 3 *Enchantment*): 1d4 enemies you can see of the
GM’s choice fall asleep. Only creatures capable of sleeping are
affected. They awake as normal: loud noises, jolts, pain.

## Level 5 Spells

* [ ] Cage (Level 5 *Evocation Ongoing*): The target is held in a cage
of magical force. Nothing can get in or out of the cage. The cage
remains until you cast another spell or dismiss it. While the spell is
ongoing, the caged creature can hear your thoughts and you cannot leave
sight of the cage.

* [ ] Contact Other Plane (Level 5 *Divination*): You send a request to
another plane. Specify who or what you’d like to contact by location,
type of creature, name, or title. You open a two-way communication with
that creature. Your communication can be cut off at any time by you or
the creature you contacted.

* [ ] Polymorph (Level 5 *Enchantment*): Your touch reshapes a creature
entirely, they stay in the form you craft until you cast a spell.
Describe the new shape you craft, including any stat changes,
significant adaptations, or major weaknesses. The GM will then tell you
one or more of these: 1) The form will be unstable and temporary. 2)
The creature’s mind will be altered as well. 3) The form has an
unintended benefit or weakness.

* [ ] Summon Monster (Level 5 *Summoning Ongoing*): A monster appears
and aids you as best it can. Treat it as your character, but with
access to only the basic moves. It has +1 modifier for all stats, 1 HP,
and uses your damage dice. The GM will tell you the type of monster you
get based on the traits you select. The creature remains on this plane
until it dies or you dismiss it. While the spell is ongoing you take -1
to cast a spell. The monster also gets your choice of 1d6 of these
traits: 1) It has +2 instead of +1 to one stat. 2) It’s not reckless.
3) It does 1d8 damage. 4) Its bond to your plane is strong: +2 HP for
each level you have. 5) It has some useful adaptation.

## Level 7 Spells

* [ ] Dominate (Level 7 *Enchantment Ongoing*): Your touch pushes your
mind into someone else’s. You gain 1d4 hold. If you run out of hold the
spell ends. If the target takes damage you lose 1 hold. While the spell
is ongoing you cannot cast a spell. Spend one hold to make the target
take one of these actions: 1) Speak a few words of your choice. 2) Give
you something they hold. 3) Make a concerted attack on a target of your
choice. 4) Truthfully answer one question.

* [ ] True Seeing (Level 7 *Divination Ongoing*): You see all things as
they truly are. This effect persists until you tell a lie or dismiss
the spell. While this spell is ongoing you take -1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Shadow Walk (Level 7 *Illusion*) The shadows you target with this
spell become a portal for you and your allies. Name a location,
describing it with a number of words up to your level. Stepping through
the portal deposits you and any allies present when you cast the spell
at the location you described. The portal may only be used once by each
ally.

* [ ] Contingency (Level 7 *Evocation*): Choose a 5th level or lower
spell you know. Describe a trigger condition using a number of words
equal to your level. The chosen spell is held until you choose to
unleash it or the trigger condition is met, whichever happens first.
You don’t have to roll for the held spell, it just takes effect. You
may only have a single contingent spell held at a time; if you cast
Contingency while you have a held spell, the new held spell replaces
the old one.

* [ ] Cloudkill (Level 7 *Summoning Ongoing*): A cloud of fog drifts
into this realm from beyond the Black Gates of Death, filling the
immediate area. Whenever a creature in the area takes damage it takes
an additional, separate 1d6 damage which ignores armor. This spell
persists so long as you can see the affected area, or until you dismiss
it.

## Level 9 Spells

* [ ] Antipathy (Level 9 *Enchantment Ongoing*): Choose a target and
describe a type of creature or an alignment. Creatures of the specified
type or alignment cannot come within sight of the target. If a creature
of the specified type does find itself within sight of the target, it
immediately flees. This effect continues until you leave the target’s
presence or you dismiss the spell. While the spell is ongoing you take
-1 to cast a spell.

* [ ] Alert (Level 9 *Divination*): Describe an event. The GM will tell
you when that event occurs, no matter where you are or how far away the
event is. If you choose, you can view the location of the event as
though you were there in person. You can only have one Alert active at
a time.

* [ ] Soul Gem (Level 9): You trap the soul of a dying creature within
a gem. The trapped creature is aware of its imprisonment but can still
be manipulated through spells, parley, and other effects. All moves
against the trapped creature are at +1. You can free the soul at any
time but it can never be recaptured once freed.

* [ ] Shelter (Level 9 *Evocation Ongoing*): You create a structure out
of pure magical power. It can be as large as a castle or as small as a
hut, but is impervious to all non-magical damage. The structure endures
until you leave it or you end the spell.

* [ ] Perfect Summons (Level 9 *Summoning*): You teleport a creature to
your presence. Name a creature or give a short description of a type of
creature. If you named a creature, that creature appears before you. If
you described a type of creature, a creature of that type appears
before you.

# Equipment

The musty tombs and forgotten treasure troves of the world are filled
with useful items. The fighter can find a sharp new sword or the thief
might stumble across a deadly poison. Most items are mundane—not
magical or intrinsically unique in any way. Any item that is magical or
one-of-a-kind is not mundane for the purposes of moves. The fighter’s
signature weapon is never mundane.

Each piece of equipment will have a number of tags. These will tell you
something about how the equipment affects the character using it (like
+Armor) or suggest something about the way it is used (like the Range
tags). Like everything else in Dungeon World, these guide the fiction
you’re creating in play. If a weapon is awkward, it might mean that
you’re more likely to drop it when you fail that hack and slash roll.

By no means is this an exhaustive list—feel free to create your own
tags.

## General Equipment Tags

These are general tags that can apply to just about any piece of gear.
You’ll see them on armor, weapons or general adventuring tools.

* *Applied*: It’s only useful when carefully applied to a person or to
something they eat or drink.
* *Awkward*: It’s unwieldy and tough to use.
* *+Bonus*: It modifies your effectiveness in a specified situation. It
might be “+1 forward to spout lore” or “-1 ongoing to hack and slash.”
* *n coins*: How much it costs to buy, normally. If the cost includes
* “-Charisma” a little negotiation subtracts the haggler’s Charisma
score (not modifier) from the price.
* *Dangerous*: It’s easy to get in trouble with it. If you interact
with it without proper precautions the GM may freely invoke the
consequences of your foolish actions.
* *Ration*: It’s edible, more or less.
* *Requires*: It’s only useful to certain people. If you don’t meet the
requirements it works poorly, if at all.
* *Slow*: It takes minutes or more to use.
* *Touch*: It’s used by touching it to the target’s skin.
* *Two-handed*: It takes two hands to use it effectively.
* *n weight*: Count the listed amount against your load. Something with
no listed weight isn’t designed to be carried. 100 coins in standard
denominations is 1 weight. The same value in gems or fine art may be
lighter or heavier.
* *Worn*: To use it, you have to be wearing it.
* *n Uses*: It can only be used *n* times.

## Weapons

Weapons don’t kill monsters, people do. That’s why weapons in Dungeon
World don’t have a listed damage. A weapon is useful primarily for its
tags which describe what the weapon is useful for. A dagger is not
useful because it does more or less damage than some other blade. It’s
useful because it’s small and easy to strike with at close distance. A
dagger in the hands of the wizard is not nearly so dangerous as one in
the hands of a skilled fighter.

## Weapon Tags

Weapons may have tags that are primarily there to help you describe
them (like Rusty or Glowing) but these tags have a specific, mechanical
effect.

* *n Ammo*: It counts as ammunition for appropriate ranged weapons. The
number indicated does not represent individual arrows or sling stones,
but represents what you have left on hand.
* *Forceful*: It can knock someone back a pace, maybe even off their
feet.
* *+n Damage*: It is particularly harmful to your enemies. When you
deal damage, you add *n* to it.
* *Ignores Armor*: Don’t subtract armor from the damage taken.
* *Messy*: It does damage in a particularly destructive way, ripping
people and things apart.
* *n Piercing*: It goes right through armor. When you deal damage with
*n* piercing, you subtract *n* from the enemy’s armor for that attack.
* *Precise*: It rewards careful strikes. You use DEX to hack and slash
with this weapon, not STR.
* *Reload*: After you attack with it, it takes more than a moment to
reset for another attack.
* *Stun*: When you attack with it, it does stun damage instead of
normal damage.
* *Thrown*: Throw it at someone to hurt them. If you volley with this
weapon, you can’t choose to mark off ammo on a 7–9; once you throw it,
it’s gone until you can recover it.

Weapons have tags to indicate the range at which they are useful.
Dungeon World doesn’t inflict penalties or grant bonuses for “optimal
range” or the like, but if your weapon says Hand and an enemy is ten
yards away, a player would have a hard time justifying using that
weapon against him.

* *Hand*: It’s useful for attacking something within your reach, no
further.
* *Close*: It’s useful for attacking something at arm’s reach plus a
foot or two.
* *Reach*: It’s useful for attacking something that’s several feet
away—maybe as far as ten.
* *Near*: It’s useful for attacking if you can see the whites of their
eyes.
* *Far*: It’s useful for attacking something in shouting distance.

## Weapon List

The stats below are for typical items. There are, of course,
variations. A dull long sword might be -1 damage instead while a
masterwork dagger could be +1 damage. Consider the following to be
stats for typical weapons of their type—a specific weapon could have
different tags to represent its features.

* Ragged Bow near, 15 coins, 2 weight
* Fine Bow near, far, 60 coins, 2 weight
* Hunter’s Bow near, far, 100 coins, 1 weight
* Crossbow near, +1 damage, reload, 35 coins, 3 weight
* Bundle of Arrows 3 ammo, 1 coin, 1 weight
* Elven Arrows 4 ammo, 20 coins, 1 weight
* Club, Shillelagh close, 1 coin, 2 weight
* Staff close, two-handed, 1 coin, 1 weight
* Dagger, Shiv, Knife hand, 2 coins, 1 weight
* Throwing Dagger thrown, near, 1 coin, 0 weight
* Short Sword, Axe, Warhammer, Mace close, 8 coins, 1 weight
* Spear reach, thrown, near, 5 coins, 1 weight
* Long Sword, Battle Axe, Flail close, +1 damage, 15 coins, 2 weight
* Halberd reach, +1 damage, two-handed, 9 coins, 2 weight
* Rapier close, precise, 25 coins, 1 weight
* Dueling Rapier close, 1 piercing, precise, 50 coins, 2 weight

## Armor

Armor is heavy, difficult to wear and is damned uncomfortable. Some
classes are better trained to ignore these drawbacks, but anyone can
strap on a suit of armor and enjoy the benefits it grants.

### Armor Tags

Armor, like weapons, has tags. Some are purely descriptive but the ones
below have some mechanical effect on the player wearing them

* *n Armor*: It protects you from harm and absorbs damage. When you
take damage, subtract your armor from the total. If you have more than
one item with *n Armor*, only the highest value counts.
* *+n Armor*: It protects you and stacks with other armor. Add its
value to your total armor.
* *Clumsy*: It’s tough to move around with. -1 ongoing while using it.
This penalty is cumulative.

### Armor List

* Leather, Chainmail 1 armor, worn, 10 coins, 1 weight
* Scale Mail 2 armor, worn, clumsy, 50 coins, 3 weight
* Plate 3 armor, worn, clumsy, 350 coins, 4 weight
* Shield +1 armor, 15 coins, 2 weight

## Dungeon Gear

* Adventuring Gear (5 uses, 20 coins, 1 weight): Adventuring gear is a
collection of useful mundane items such as chalk, poles, spikes, ropes,
etc. When you rummage through your adventuring gear for some useful
mundane item, you find what you need and mark off a use.

* Bandages (3 uses, slow, 5 coins, 0 weight): When you have a few
minutes to bandage someone else’s wounds, heal them of 4 damage and
expend a use.
* Poultices and Herbs (2 uses, slow, 10 coins, 1 weight): When you
carefully treat someone’s wounds with poultices and herbs, heal them of
7 damage and expend a use.
* Healing Potion (50 coins, 0 weight): When you drink an entire healing
potion, heal yourself of 10 damage or remove one debility, your choice.
* Keg of Dwarven Stout (10 coins, 4 weight): When you open a keg of
dwarven stout and let everyone drink freely, take +1 to your Carouse
roll. If you drink a whole keg yourself, you are very, very drunk.
* Bag of Books (5 uses, 10 coins, 2 weight): When your bag of books
contains just the right book for the subject you’re spouting lore on,
consult the book, mark off a use, and take +1 to your roll.
* Antitoxin (10 coins, 0 weight): When you drink antitoxin, you’re
cured of one poison affecting you.
* Dungeon Rations (Ration, 5 uses, 3 coins, 1 weight): Not tasty, but
not bad either.
* Personal Feast (Ration, 1 use, 10 coins, 1 weight): Ostentatious to
say the least.
* Dwarven Hardtack (Requires Dwarf, ration, 7 uses, 3 coins, 1 weight):
Dwarves say it tastes like home. Everyone else says it tastes like
home, if home is a hog farm, and on fire.
* Elven Bread (Ration, 7 uses, 10 coins, 1 weight): Only the greatest
of elf-friends are treated to this rare delicacy.
* Halfling Pipeleaf (6 uses, 5 coins, 0 weight): When you share
halfling pipeleaf with someone, expend two uses and take +1 forward to
parley with them.

## Poisons

* Oil of Tagit (Dangerous, applied, 15 coins, 0 weight): The target
falls into a light sleep.
* Bloodweed (Dangerous, touch, 12 coins, 0 weight): Until cured,
whenever the afflicted rolls damage, they roll an additional d4 and
subtract that result from their normal damage.
* Goldenroot (Dangerous, applied, 20 coins, 0 weight): The target
treats the next creature they see as a trusted ally, until proved
otherwise.
* Serpent’s Tears (Dangerous, touch, 10 coins, 0 weight): Anyone
dealing damage against the target rolls twice and takes the better
result.

# GM Moves

Whenever everyone looks to you to see what happens choose one of these.
Each move is something that occurs in the fiction of the game—they
aren’t code words or special terms. “Use up their resources” literally
means to expend the resources of the characters, for example.

* Use a monster, danger, or location move
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
* Show signs of an approaching threat
* Deal damage
* Use up their resources
* Turn their move back on them
* Separate them
* Give an opportunity that fits a class’ abilities
* Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment
* Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
* Put someone in a spot
* Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask

No matter what move you make, always follow up with “What do you do?”
Your moves are a way of fulfilling your agenda—part of which is to fill
the characters’ lives with adventure. When a spell goes wild or the
floor drops out from under them adventurers react or suffer the
consequences of inaction.

## When to Make a Move

You make a move:

* When everyone looks to you to find out what happens
* When the players give you a golden opportunity
* When they roll a 6-

Generally when the players are just looking at you to find out what
happens you make a soft move, otherwise you make a hard move.

A soft move is one without immediate, irrevocable consequences. That
usually means it’s something not all that bad, like revealing that
there’s more treasure if they can just find a way past the golem (offer
an opportunity with cost). It can also mean that it’s something bad,
but they have time to avoid it, like having the goblin archers loose
their arrows (show signs of an approaching threat) with a chance for
them to dodge out of danger.

A soft move ignored becomes a golden opportunity for a hard move. If
the players do nothing about the hail of arrows flying towards them
it’s a golden opportunity to use the deal damage move.

Hard moves, on the other hand, have immediate consequences. Dealing
damage is almost always a hard move, since it means a loss of HP that
won’t be recovered without some action from the players.

When you have a chance to make a hard move you can opt for a soft one
instead if it better fits the situation. Sometimes things just work out
for the best.

## Choosing a Move

To choose a move, start by looking at the obvious consequences of the
action that triggered it. If you already have an idea, think on it for
a second to make sure it fits your agenda and principles and then do
it. **Let your moves snowball**. Build on the success or failure of the
characters’ moves and on your own previous moves.

If your first instinct is that this won’t hurt them now, but it’ll come
back to bite them later, great! That’s part of your principles (think
offscreen too). Make a note of and reveal it when the time is right.

Note that “deal damage” is a move, but other moves may include damage
as well. When an ogre flings you against a wall you take damage as
surely as if he had smashed you with his fists.

After every move you make, always ask “What do you do?”

## Dungeon Moves

Dungeon Moves are a special subset that are used to make or alter a
dungeon on the fly. Use these if your players are exploring a hostile
area that you don’t already have planned completely.

* Change the environment
* Point to a looming threat
* Introduce a new faction or type of creature
* Use a threat from an existing faction or type of creature
* Make them backtrack
* Present riches at a price
* Present a challenge to one of the characters

You can make these moves whenever everyone looks to you to say
something, when the players present you an opportunity, or when the
players miss on a roll. They’re particularly well-suited for when the
characters enter a new room or hallway and want to know what they find
there.

# Magic Items

There are stranger things in the world than swords and leather. Magic
items are the non-mundane items that have intrinsic power.

Magic items are for you to make for your game. Players can make magic
items through the wizard’s ritual and similar moves. The GM can
introduce magic items in the spoils of battle or the rewards for jobs
and quests. This list provides some ideas, but magic items are
ultimately for you to decide.

When making your own magic items keep in mind that these items are
*magical*. Simple modifiers, like+1 damage, are the realm of the
mundane—magic items should provide more interesting bonuses.

**Argo-Thaan, Holy Avenger** (Close, 2 weight) There are many swords
in this world, but there is only one Argo-thaan. It is a blade of gold,
silver and light, revered as a holy relic by all orders and religions
for whom Good rings true. Its touch is a blessing and to many, the
sight of it brings tears of joy. In the hands of a paladin, it strikes
true and strong. A paladin wielding it increases their damage die to
d12 and has access to every paladin move. As well, Argo-thaan can harm
any creature of Evil, regardless of any defenses it may have. No Evil
creature may touch it without suffering agony. In the hands of any
non-paladin, it is merely a sword, heavier and more cumbersome than
most—it gains the awkward tag. Argo-thaan, while not intelligent, will
forever be drawn to a cause of true Good, like iron to a magnet.

**Arrows of Acheron** (1 ammo, 1 weight) Crafted in darkness by a
blind fletcher, these arrows can find their target in even the deepest
darkness. An archer may fire them blind, in the dark, with his eyes
bound by heavy cloth and still be assured of a clean shot. If the light
of the sun ever touches the arrows, however, they come apart like
shadows and dust.

**Axe of the Conqueror-King** (Close, 1 weight) It is crafted of
shining steel, glowing with a golden light and imbued with mythical
powers of authority. When you bear the axe, you become a beacon of
inspiration to all you lead. Any hirelings in your employ have +1
Loyalty, no matter the quality of your leadership.

**Barb of the Black Gate** (0 weight) A nail or spike, twisted and
forever cold, said to have been pried from the Gates of Death. When
hammered into a corpse, it disappears and ensures that corpse will
never be risen again—no magic short of that of Death himself can
reignite the flame of life (natural or otherwise) in the body.

**Bag of Holding** (0 weight) A bag of holding is larger on the inside
than the outside, it can contain an infinite number of items, and its
weight never increases. No matter how many items it contains, a bag of
holding is always 0 weight. When you try to retrieve an item from a bag
of holding, roll+WIS. ***On a 10+***, it’s right there. ✴On a 7-9,
choose one: 1) You get the exact item, but it takes a while. 2) You get
a similar item of the GM’s choice, but it only takes a moment.

**The Burning Wheel** (2 weight) An ancient wooden wheel, as might
appear on a war-wagon, banded with steel. On a glance, it appears to be
nothing special—many spokes are shattered and the thing seems mundane.
Under the scrutiny of magic or the eyes of an expert, its true nature
is revealed: the Burning Wheel is a gift from the God of Fire and burns
with his authority. When you hold The Burning Wheel and speak a god’s
name, roll+CON. ✴On a 7+, the god you name takes notice and grants you
an audience. An audience with a god is not without a price: on a 10+,
you choose one of your stats and reduce it to the next lowest modifier
(for example, a 14 is +1, so it would be reduced to 12, a +0). ***On a
7–9***, the GM chooses which stat to reduce. Once used, the Burning
Wheel ignites and burns with brilliant light. It does not confer any
protection from those flames, nor does it provide any bonus to
swimming.

**Captain Bligh’s Cornucopia** (1 weight) A brass naval horn, curled
and ornate, carved with symbols of the gods of Plenty. When blown, in
addition to sound, the horn spills forth food. Enough to feed a meal to
everyone who hears its sound.

**The Carcosan Spire** (Reach, Thrown, 3 weight) None know from whence
this spear of twisted white coral comes. Those who bear it too long
find their minds full of alien dreams and begin to hear the strange
thoughts of the Others. None are impervious. Used against any “natural”
target** (men, goblins, owlbears and the like) the Spire acts as a mere
mortal spear. Its true purpose is to do harm to those things whose
strange natures protect them against mundane weapons. Used thus, the
Spire can wound foes otherwise invulnerable to harm. The wielder will
recognize these twisted foes on sight—the Spire knows its own.

**Cloak of Silent Stars** (1 weight) A cape of rich black velvet
outside and sparkling with tiny points of light within, this cloak
bends fate, time and reality around it to protect the wearer, who may
defy danger with whatever stat they like. To do this, the wearer
invokes the cloak’s magic and their player describes how the cloak
helps “break the rules.” They can deflect a fireball with CHA by
convincing it they deserve to live or elude a fall by applying the
mighty logic of their INT to prove the fall won’t hurt. The cloak makes
it so. It can be used once for each stat before losing its magic.

**Coin of Remembering** (0 weight) What appears, at a glance, to be a
simple copper coin is, in truth, an enchanted coin. Its bearer can, at
any time, redeem it to know immediately one fact that has been
forgotten. The coin vanishes thereafter. It does not have to be a thing
forgotten by the bearer, but it cannot be “known.” Interpretation of
this stipulation is left to the gods. If the coin is unsuccessful, it
will still paint an image in the mind’s eye of someone or something
that does remember what was sought.

**Common Scroll** (1 use, 0 weight) A common scroll has a spell inscribed
on it. The spell must be castable by you or on your class’s spell list
for you to be able to cast it. When you cast a spell from a scroll, the
spell takes effect, simple as that.

**Devilsbane Oil** (1 use, 0 weight) A holy oil, created in limited
supply by a mute sect of mountain monks whose order protected humanity
from the powers of the Demon Pits in ancient epochs. Only a few jars
remain. When applied to any weapon and used to strike a denizen of any
outer plane, the oil undoes the magic that binds that creature. In some
cases, this will return it to its home. In others, it merely undoes any
magic controlling it. The oil stays on the weapon for a few hours
before it dries and flakes away. If applied to the edges of a doorway
or drawn in a circle, the oil will repel creatures whose home is any of
the outer planes. They cannot pass across it. The oil lasts for one
full day before it soaks in or evaporates.

**Earworm Wax** (1 use, 0 weight) A yellowish candle. Seems never to
burn out and the light it casts is strange and weak. Its wax is always
cool, too. Drip the wax into the ear of a target and gain 3 hold. Spend
that hold and ask your target a question. They find themselves telling
you the whole truth, despite themselves. The consequences, after the
fact? Those are up to you to deal with.

**The Echo** (0 weight) A seemingly empty bottle. Once unstoppered, the
whispers of another plane resound once and fall silent. In the silence,
the bearer learns in his soul the coming of one great danger and how he
can avoid it. At any point after you use the Echo, you can ignore the
results of any single die roll—yours or another player’s—and roll
again. Once opened, the Echo is released and gone forever.

**The Epoch Lens** (1 weight) An archmage, old and too frail to leave
his tower, crafted this intricate and fragile device of glass and gold
to examine the histories and relics he so loved. Looking at an object
through the lens reveals visions of who made it and where it came from.

**Farsight Stone** (1 weight) Swirling clouds fill this smoky orb and
those in its presence often hear strange whispers. In ancient times, it
was part of a network of such stones, used to communicate and surveil
across great distances. When you gaze into the stone, name a location
and roll+WIS. ***On a 10+***, you see a clear vision of the location
and can maintain it as long as you concentrate on the orb. ***On a
7–9***, you still see the vision, but you draw the attention of some
other thing (an angel, a demon, or the holder of another Farsight
stone) that uses the stone to surveil you, as well.

**The Fiasco Codex** (0 weight) A thick tome, said to be penned in the
blood of poor fools and robber-barons by some demon prince possessed of
dark humor, this tome details tales and stories of those whose ambition
overwhelmed their reason. Reading from this tome teaches one the value
of clear-headedness but leaves a sense of dread behind. When you read
from the Fiasco Codex, Roll+WIS. ***On a 10+***, ask two of the
questions below. ***On a 7–9***, ask one. 1) What is my greatest
opportunity, right now?. 2) Who can I betray to gain an advantage? 3)
Who is an ally I should not trust? The codex gives up its answers only
once to each reader and takes 2 to 3 hours to read.

**Flask of Breath** (0 weight) A simple thing, but useful when you need
a breath of fresh air. The flask appears empty but cannot be filled,
anything added to it simply spills out. This is because the flask is
eternally full of air. If placed underwater, it will bubble forever. If
pressed to the mouth, one can breathe normally—smoke is no concern, for
example. I’m sure you’ll find all sorts of unusual uses for it.

**Folly Held Aloft, The Wax Wings, A Huge Mistake** (1 weight) Who
hasn’t always wanted to soar the pretty blue sky? In an attempt to
grant the wishes of land-bound folk, these great magical wings were
created. Known by many names and crafted by as many mages, they
commonly take the shape of the wings of whatever local birds hold
affection. Worn by means of a harness or, in some dire cases, a
surgical procedure. When you take to the air with these magical wings,
roll+DEX. ***On a 10+***, your flight is controlled and you may stay
aloft as long as you like. ***On a 7–9***, you make it aloft but your
flight is short or erratic and unpredictable, your choice. ***On a
6-***, you make it aloft, but the coming-down part and everything
between is up to the GM.

**Immovable Rod** (0 weight) A funny metal rod with a button on it.
Press the button and the rod just sticks. It freezes in place—in
midair, standing up or lying down. It can’t be moved. Pull it, push it,
try as hard as you like, the rod stays. Maybe it can be destroyed,
maybe it can’t. Push the button again and it’s free—take it along with
you. Might be useful to have such a stubborn thing along.

**Infinite Book** (1 weight) This book contains an infinite number of
pages in a finite space. With no limit to the pages, everything that
ever was, is, or will be is contained somewhere in the book. Luckily
the index is great. When you spout lore while consulting the book you
gain an extra clause: On a 12+, the GM will give a solution to a
problem or situation you’re in.

**Inspectacles** (0 weight) Rough-hewn glass in wooden frames. Dinged
up and barely held together, they somehow allow the wearer to see much
more than their naked eyes might. When you discern realities wearing
these gifted lenses, you get to bend the rules a little. On a roll of
10+, ask any three questions you like. They don’t have to be on the
list. As long as sight could give you answers, the GM will tell you
what you want to know.

**The Ku’meh Maneuver** (1 weight) A great, leathery tome worn shiny by
the hands of a hundred great generals, this book is often passed from
warrior to warrior, from father to son along the great battle lines
that have divided Dungeon World’s past. Anyone reading it may, upon
finishing for the first time, roll+INT. ***On a 10+***, hold 3. ***On a
7-9***, hold 1. You may spend your hold to advise a companion on some
matter of strategic or tactical significance. This advice allows you
to, at any time, regardless of distance, roll to aid them on any one
roll. On a miss, the GM can hold 1 and spend it to apply -2 to any roll
of yours or the poor sap who listened to your advice.

**Lamented Memento** (0 weight) Taking the form of a single lock of
bright red hair, bound in a black ribbon and immune to the ravages of
time, the Lamented Memento bears a grim enchantment. In it are the
memories and emotions of a girl who dealt with Death at the Black Gates
so many times that, in the end, they fell in love and she left the
world to be with him for a time. Her memory protects the wielder. If he
finds himself at the Gates, the Memento can be traded for an automatic
result of 10+ on the Last Breath move.

**Lodestone Shield** (+1 armor, 1 weight) What mixed-up dummy made
this? Shields are meant to repel metal, not draw it in! Emblazoned with
a lion rampant, the Lodestone Shield has the power to pull blades and
arrows to it. When you defend against enemies using metal weapons you
can spend one hold, per target, to disarm them. Also, sometimes you’ll
find a handful of loose change stuck to it.

**Map of the Last Patrol** (0 weight) An ancient order of brave rangers
once patrolled the land, protecting villages and warning kings and
queens of encroaching danger. They’re long gone, now, but their legacy
remains. This map, when marked with the blood of a group of people,
will always show their location—so long as they remain within the
bounds of the map.

**Ned’s Head** (1 weight) An old skull, missing its jaw and very much
worse-for-wear. The skull remembers the folly of its former owner—a man
with more honor than sense. Once per night, the owner of the skull can
ask “Who has it in for me?” and the skull will give up one name in a
sad, lonely voice. If the owner of the skull is ever killed, it
disappears surreptitiously. No one knows where it might turn up next.

**Nightsider’s Key** (0 weight) This key unlocks any door for you,
provided you don’t belong where you intend to go. So long as you do
nothing that would alert another to your presence (remaining unheard,
unseen and unnoticed) and takes nothing more than your memories out
with you, the key’s magic will prevent your intrusion from ever being
discovered. It’s like you were never there at all.

**Sacred Herbs** (0 weight) The sacred herbs, collected and prepared by
an order of lost wizard-monks, can be found in bundles with two or
three uses to them. Kept dry, they last indefinitely. When smoked in a
pipe or consumed in an incense burner and the thick, blue smoke
inhaled, these herbs will grant you strange visions of faraway places
and distant times. If you focus your will on a particular person, place
or thing, the herbs will respond: roll+WIS. ***On a 10+***, the vision
is clear and useful—yielding some valid information. ***On a 7–9***,
the vision is about the thing desired, but is unclear, fraught with
metaphor or somehow difficult to understand. ✴On a miss, the GM will
ask you, “What is it you fear most?” You must answer honestly, of
course.

**The Sartar Duck** (0 weight) An odd, hand-carved wooden duck. Who
would make such a funny thing? While you bear it, you find yourself an
exceptionally gifted storyteller—no matter the language, you can make
yourself and your story clear to any audience. They will understand
your meaning, if not your words.

**Tears of Annalise** (0 weight) Cloudy red gemstones the size of a
thumbnail, the Tears of Annalise are always found in pairs. When
swallowed by two different people, they bind the swallowers
together—when either feels strong emotions (particularly sadness, loss,
fear or desire) the other feels it, as well. The effects last until one
spills the blood of the other.

**Teleportation Room** (Slow) James Ninefingers, eccentric genius mage,
created these room-sized magical apparati. A stone chamber etched with
runes and scribblings, glowing with a faint blue light. When you enter
and say aloud the name of a location, roll+INT. ***On a 10+***, you
arrive exactly where you’d intended. ***On a 7–9***, the GM chooses a
safe location nearby. ***On a 6-***, you end up someplace. Maybe it’s
nearby? It’s definitely not safe. Strange things sometimes happen to
those who bend time and space with these devices.

**Timunn’s Armor** (1 armor, 1 weight) A stealthy suit of armor, it
appears as many things to many people and blends in with appropriate
apparel. The wearer always seems the height of fashion to any who gaze
upon him.

**Titus’ Truthful Tallow** (0 weight) A candle of ivory- and
copper-colored tallow with a wick of spun silver. When lit, none upon
whom its light falls is able to tell a lie. They may keep silent or
dissemble but when asked a question directly, they can speak naught but
truth.

**Tricksy Rope** (1 weight) A rope that listens. Does tricks, too, like
a smart and more obedient snake might. Tell it “Coil” or “Slack” or
“Come here, rope” and it will.

**The Sterling Hand** (0 weight) Crafted by dwarven whitesmiths, this
mirrored-metal hand is deeply scored with runes of power and
rejuvenation. Meant to replace wounded or destroyed limbs from mining
accidents, the Sterling Hand bonds to the wound, old or new, and is
strong and stout. It can be used as a weapon** (Near range) and is made
of pure enough silver to harm creatures affected by such.

**Vellius’s Gauntlets** (1 weight) Crafted in the name of Vellius the
Clumsy, Vellius the Butter-Fingered, Vellius the Clod, these gloves of
simple cloth prevent you from dropping any object you don’t intent to.
You cannot be disarmed and will not fall from any rope or ladder, for
example. This item can get very messy if you have something strong
pulling at your legs while you grip onto something solid.

**Violation Glaive** (Reach, 2 weight) A legendary blade, said to have
been thrust backwards in time from some grim future, the violation
glaive is crafted of strange green iron. The blade strikes at the mind
of those it wounds, as well as the body. When you hack and slash on a
10+ you have an additional option: you can deal your normal damage, let
them counterattack you, and instill the emotion of your choice (maybe
fear, reverence, or trust).

**Vorpal Sword** (Close, 3 piercing, 2 weight) Snicker-snack and all
that. Sharp as anything, this simple-seeming sword means to separate
one thing from another—the limb from the body or folk from their lives.
When you deal damage with the Vorpal Sword, your enemy must choose
something (an item, an advantage, a limb) and lose it, permanently.

# Monsters

Every monster has **moves** that describe its behavior and abilities.
Just like the normal GM moves, they’re things that you do when there’s
a lull in the action or when the players give you a golden opportunity.
As with other GM moves they can be hard or soft depending on the
circumstances and the move: a move that’s irreversible and immediate is
hard, a move that’s impending or easy to counter is soft.

Each monster has **tags** that describe how it deals damage, including
the range(s) of its attacks. When trying to attack something out of its
range (too close or too far) the monster’s out of luck, no damage. Any
tag that can go on a weapon (like messy or slow) can also go on a
monster.

There are special tags that apply only to monsters. These tags, listed
below, describe the key attributes of the monster—qualities that
describe how big they are and how, if at all, they organize themselves.

A monster’s **HP** is a measure of how much damage it can take before
it dies. Just like players, when a monster takes damage it subtracts
that amount from its HP. At 0 HP it’s dead, no last breath.

Some monsters are lucky enough to enjoy **armor**. It’s just like
player armor: when a monster with armor takes damage it subtracts its
armor from the damage done.

**Special qualities** describe innate aspects of the monster that are
important to play. These are a guide to the fiction, and therefore the
moves. A quality like intangible means just what it says: mundane stuff
just passes through it. That means swinging a mundane sword at it isn’t
hack and slash, for a start.

## Monster Tags

* *Magical*: It is by nature magical through and through.
* *Devious*: Its main danger lies beyond the simple clash of battle.
* *Amorphous*: Its anatomy and organs are bizarre and unnatural.
* *Organized*: It has a group structure that aids it in survival.
Defeating one may cause the wrath of others. One may sound an alarm.
* *Intelligent*: It’s smart enough that some individuals pick up other
skills. The GM can adapt the monster by adding tags to reflect specific
training, like a mage or warrior.
* *Hoarder*: It almost certainly has treasure.
* *Stealthy*: It can avoid detection and prefers to attack with the
element of surprise.
* *Terrifying*: Its presence and appearance evoke fear.
* *Cautious*: It prizes survival over aggression.
* *Construct*: It was made, not born.
* *Planar*: It’s from beyond this world.
* *Horde*: Where there’s one, there’s more. A lot more.
* *Group*: Usually seen in small numbers, 3–6 or so.
* *Solitary*: It lives and fights alone.
* *Tiny*: It’s much smaller than a halfling.
* *Small*: It’s about halfling size.
* *Large*: It’s much bigger than a human, about as big as a cart.
* *Huge*: It’s as big as a small house or larger.
