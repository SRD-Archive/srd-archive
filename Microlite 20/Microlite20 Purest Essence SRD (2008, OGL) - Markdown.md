# Microlite 20 Purest Essence SRD

Microlite 20 PE by Robin V. Stacey, Darrell King & Al Krombach

This is a trimmed-down, subminiature version of the Primary Fantasy SRD 
rules (see license for more info) that has been designed to be quick 
and easy to play.

The goal was to create a simpler game, but one where all of the 
resources of Primary Fantasy SRD (monsters, spells, adventures and 
equipment) could be used without conversion.

# Characters

## Stats

There are 3 stats : Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX) and Mind (MIND).

Roll 4d6, drop lowest dice. Total remaining 3 dice and allocate to one 
of the stats. Repeat for remaining stats. Stat bonus = (STAT-10)/2, 
round down.

## Races

* Humans get +1 to all skill rolls
* Elves get +2 MIND
* Dwarves get +2 STR
* Halflings get +2 DEX

## Classes

The classes are Fighter, Rogue, Mage, Cleric. Characters begin at Level 
1.

**Fighters**

Wear any kind of armour and use shields. They have a +3 bonus to 
Physical and add +1 to all attack and damage rolls. This increases by 
+1 at 5th level and every five levels on

**Rogues**

Can use light armour. They have a +3 bonus to Subterfuge. If they 
successfully Sneak (usually sub+DEX, but depends on situation) up on a 
foe they can add their Subterfuge skill rank to the damage of their 
first attack

**Magi**

Wear no armour. They can cast arcane spells, and gain a +3 bonus to 
Knowledge

**Clerics**

Can wear light or medium armour. They cast divine spells and gain +3 
bonus to Communication. A Cleric can Turn Undead with a successful 
Magic Attack. DC is the current Hit Points of the Undead. If the DC is 
exceeded by 10 it is destroyed. This can be used (2 + Level + MIND 
Bonus) times per day.

## Skills

There are just 4 skills : Physical, Subterfuge, Knowledge and 
Communication. Roll higher than the given Difficulty Class to succeed. 
(Very easy: 5, Easy: 10, Medium: 15, Hard: 20, Very hard: 25, Nearly 
impossible: 30).

Skill rank = your level + any bonus due to your class or race.

Skill roll = d20 + skill rank + whatever stat bonus is most applicable 
to the use + situation modifiers

For example, Climbing would use Physical + STR bonus. Dodging a falling 
rock is Physical + DEX bonus. Finding a trap is Subterfuge + MIND 
bonus. Disabling a trap is Subterfuge + DEX bonus.

Note that there are no “saving throws” in this game; use Physical + STR 
or DEX bonus for Fortitude and Reflex saves. Saving against magic (Will 
save) is usually MIND bonus + your level.

## Magic

Magi can cast any arcane spell, and Clerics any divine spell, with a 
spell level equal or below 1/2 their class level, rounded up. They have 
access to all arcane spells in the SRD spell list.

Casting a spell of any kind costs Hit Points. The cost is: 1 + double 
the level of the spell being cast.

This loss cannot be healed normally but is recovered after 8 hours 
rest. *There is no need to memorize spells in advance.*

Just because a character can cast any spell, doesn't mean that they 
should. Choose spells that suit the character. Select one ‘signature' 
spell per spell level from 1st upward that they pre- fer to use over 
any other. These spells are easier to cast due to familiarity, costing 
1 less HP to use.

The Difficulty Class (DC) for all spells: 10 + Caster Level + Caster's 
MIND bonus

## Combat

Hit Points = STR Stat + 1d6/Level. If HP reach 0, unconscious and near 
death. Further damage directly reduces STR. If that reaches 0, death.

Roll d20 + DEX bonus for initiative order. Everyone can do one thing 
each turn; move, attack, cast a spell, etc.

* Melee attack bonus = STR bonus + Level
* Missile attack bonus = DEX bonus + Level
* Magic attack bonus = MIND bonus + Level

Add attack bonus to d20 roll. If higher than your opponent's Armour 
Class (AC), it's a hit. Natural 20 is automatically a critical doing 
maximum damage.

Fighters and Rogues can use DEX bonus + Level as Melee attack bonus 
instead if wielding a light weapon. Fighters and Rogues can wield 2 
light weapons and attack with both in a round if they take a -2 penalty 
on all attack rolls that round. Rapiers count as light weapons, but you 
cannot wield two rapiers at the same time.

If the total bonus is +6 or more a second attack can be made with a -5 
penalty. If the total bonus is +11 or more a third attack can be made 
at -10. For example, if the total bonus is +12, three attacks can be 
made at +12/+7/+2.

Add STR bonus to Melee damage, x2 for 2-handed weapons. Armour Class 
(AC) = 10 + DEX bonus + Armour bonus.

Note: A touch attack (or an attack against Touch AC) is against the 
targets AC without their armor bonus. A flat-footed attack (or an 
attack against Flat-Footed AC) is against the targets AC without their 
DEX bonus.

## Other Hazards

* Falling: 1d6 damage per 10', half damage on Phys+DEX save. DC=depth 
fallen in feet
* Spikes: add +1 point to falling damage per 10' fallen, max +10
* Poison: Phys+STR save to avoid or for half, depending on poison.
Effect varies with poison type.
* Extreme Heat & Cold: If not wearing suitable protection, Phys+STR 
save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), 
taking 1d6 damage on each failed save.

# Level Advancement

Encounter Level = Hit Dice of defeated monsters, or the given EL for 
the trap, situation, etc. Add +1 for each doubling of the number of 
foes. eg: 1 kobold = EL1. 2 kobolds = EL2. 4 kobolds = EL3, etc.

Add up the Encounter Levels (ELs) of every encounter you take part in. 
When the total = 10 x your current level, you've advanced to the next 
level. Reset the total to 0 after advancing.

Each level adds:

* 1d6 to Hit Points
* 1 to all attack rolls
* 1 to all skills

If the level divides by three (i.e. level 3,6,9,etc.) add 1 point to 
STR, DEX or MIND.

Fighters gain +1 to their attack and damage rolls at levels 
5,10,15,etc.

Clerics and Magi gain access to new spell levels at levels 3,5,7,9,etc.

Example: *The 1st level adventurers have just completed a dungeon 
adventure, and defeated 5 EL1 encounters, an EL2 trap and the EL3 
leader. That's a total of EL10, so they all advance to level 2. They 
need to defeat another 20 Encounter Levels to reach Level 3.*

# Equipment List

## Starting Wealth

The most common coin is the gold piece (gp). A gold piece is worth 10 
silver pieces. Each silver piece is worth 10 copper pieces (cp). In 
addition to copper, silver, and gold coins there are also platinum 
pieces (pp), which are each worth 10 gp.

You begin with a certain amount of acquired wealth, determined by your 
character class.

* Fighter 150 gp
* Rogue 125 gp
* Mage 75 gp
* Cleric 120 gp

The character uses this accumulated wealth to purchase his initial

# Monsters

## Skills

All creatures have a bonus to all skills equal to their number of Hit 
Dice. If the creature is intelligent, add +3 to one skill. Add stat 
bonuses to suit and as logic dictates. This is intentionally kept open 
-- if you need a sneaky bugbear, assign the +3 bonus to Subterfuge; if 
a warrior, give +3 to Physical; for a spell-caster assign the +3 to 
Knowledge or Communication and give levels of Mage or Cleric (see 
below).

## Monster Advancement

To make a tougher monster, add more Hit Dice; each additional HD adds 
one to their skill and combat bonuses.

For each doubling of the Hit Dice, increase the dice size for attacks 
(ie, d4->d6, d6->d8, etc). Alternatively, add class levels to 
intelligent monsters. Start with the base Hit Dice and add levels of 
Fighter, Rogue, Mage or Cleric as required.

## Create Your Own

Assign Hit Dice (d8 for most things, d12 for Dragons and Undead).

Attack bonus and skill level = number of Hit Dice. If it's an

# Expert Rules

This rule-set allows for introducing a few more options to your 
Microlite20 game, without necessarily increasing its complexity. 
Included are: a new skill, new races, new classes, and some other 
(hopefully) good stuff. It is not necessary to use Microlite20 
Expert Rules in its entirety; DMs are encouraged to “cherry pick” 
those specific items applicable to their own campaign.

## Races

* Gnomes get +1 to DEX, +1 to MIND
* Half-orcs get +4 to STR, -2 to MIND
* Half-elves get +1 to DEX, and +1 to any 2 Skills
* Lizardmen get +2 to STR, +2 to Dex, -2 to MIND

## Classes

**Paladins**

Wear any kind of armor and use shields. They have a +1 bonus to 
Physical and a +2 bonus to Communication. They are immune to diseases 
and apply a +1 bonus to all saving throws (this increases by +1 at 5th 
level and every 5 levels on). Paladins can detect evil within 60' at 
will and can heal up to 2hp per level per day by laying on hands. A 
character must be of Lawful Good alignment to be a Paladin.

**Rangers**

Can use light or medium armor and can use shields. They are +1 to hit 
and damage with ranged weapons and only incur a -1 to hit penalty when 
fighting with 2 weapons. They have a +3 bonus to Survival.

**Illusionists**

Wear no armor. They can cast Illusionist spells and gain a +2 bonus to 
Communication and a +1 bonus to Subterfuge. Characters must have a 
minimum DEX score of 13 to be Illusionists.

**Druids**

Wear any non-metal armor or shield. They cast Druid spells and gain +2 
to Knowledge and +2 to Survival. Druids are immune to the spell-like 
effects of woodland fey. At 3rd level a Druid can pass without trace at 
will. At 7th level a Druid can assume the form of any small or medium 
sized animal up to 3 times per day. A Druid heals 2hp per level when 
changing back into his human form.

**Bards**

Wear light armor and can use bucklers. They gain a +2 bonus to 
Communication, Subterfuge, and Knowledge. A Bard can counter 
sound-based effects within a 30' radius. A Bard can use his song to 
charm person or remove fear up to 3 times (total) per day. Beginning at 
6th level, a Bard casts spells as either a Druid or Illusionist 
(player's choice) of 5 levels lower.

## Skills

Microlite20 Expert Rules adds a new, 5th skill: Survival. Survival is 
used for things like tracking, foraging, setting or spotting snares, 
hunting, finding water or rare herbs, determining direction, and the 
like. Only Rangers and Druids are specialized with this skill.

## Heroism

While Microlite20 certainly simplifies your game by declining the use 
of the endless array of “Feats” available in the SRD, this can 
sometimes decrease Microlite20's intende compatibility with some d20 
adventures, with respects to power level. Heroism is intended to 
relieve some of that disparity.

Heroism is a bonus equal to the character's level (1 at 1st, 2 at 2nd, 
etc) and may be applied three times per day to any of the following:

* Attack Bonus
* Damage
* Saving Throw
* Skill Check
* Spell DC

## Magic

Here are three ways for spell casters to add a little more variety to 
their repertoire. Each modifies a spell in a given way, and each 
doubles the casting time of the spell so modified (most spells become 
full round actions instead of standard actions, for example). Also, 
each requires an additional expenditure of hit points, added to the 
standard cost of the spell at the time it is cast.

**Extending:** Makes a spell last twice as long as it normally would. 
An Extended spell costs an additional 2hp.

**Empowering**
Makes a spell do 50% more damage than it normally would.
An Empowered spell costs an additional 4hp.

**Widening**
Makes a spell's area of effect twice as big as it would normally
be. A Widened spell costs an additional 6hp.

# When in Doubt . . . Remember

Whenever the players want to try something that goes around, through, 
or above and beyond the rules as written, you can always use the “GM's 
Friend”...the 50% chance. Have them roll whatever check seems most 
appropriate. A roll of 1-10 is a failure, a roll of 11-20 is a success. 
If you feel that the situation warrants that you favor them, assign a 
+2 bonus to their roll. If the situation determines that they be 
hindered, then assign a –2 penalty.
